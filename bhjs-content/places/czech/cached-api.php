Formerly the capital of Czechoslovakia.\n\nIt has the oldest Jewish community in Bohemia and one of the oldest communities in Europe, for some time the largest and most revered. Jews may have arrived in Prague in late roman times, but the first document mentioning them is a report by Ibrahim Ibn Ya'qub from about 970. The first definite evidence for the existence of a Jewish community in Prague dates to 1091. Jews arrived in Prague from both the east and west around the same time. It is probably for this reason that two Jewish districts came into being there right at the beginning.\n\nThe relatively favorable conditions in which the Jews at first lived in Prague were disrupted at the time of the first crusade in 1096. The crusaders murdered many of the Jews in Prague, looted Jewish property, and forced many to accept baptism. During the siege of Prague castle in 1142, the oldest synagogue in Prague and the Jewish quarter below the castle were burned down and the Jews moved to the right bank of the river Moldau (vltava), which was to become the future Jewish quarter, and founded the \"Altschul\" (\"old synagogue\") there.\n\nThe importance of Jewish culture in Prague is evidenced by the works of the halakhists there in the 11th to 13th centuries. The most celebrated was Isaac B. Moses of Vienna (d. C. 1250) author of \"Or Zaru'a\". Since the Czech language was spoken by the Jews of Prague in the early middle ages, the halakhic writings of that period also contain annotations in Czech. From the 13th to 16th centuries the Jews of Prague increasingly spoke German. At the time of persecutions which began at the end of the 11th century, the Jews of Prague, together with all the other Jews of Europe, lost their status as free people. From the 13th century on, the Jews of Bohemia were considered servants of the royal chamber (servi camerae regis). Their residence in Prague was subject to the most humiliating conditions (the wearing of special dress, segregation in the ghetto, etc.). The only occupation that Jews were allowed to adopt was moneylending, since this was forbidden to Christians and considered dishonest. Socially the Jews were in an inferior position.\n\nThe community suffered from persecutions accompanied by bloodshed in the 13th and 14th centuries, particularly in 1298 and 1338. Charles IV (1346- 1378) protected the Jews, but after his death the worst attack occurred in 1389, when nearly all the Jews of Prague fell victims. The rabbi of Prague and noted kabbalist Avigdor Kara, who witnessed and survived the outbreak, described it in a selichah. Under Wenceslaus IV the Jews of Prague suffered heavy material losses following an order by the king in 1411 canceling all debts owed to Jews.\n\nAt the beginning of the 15th century the Jews of Prague found themselves at the center of the Hussite wars (1419- 1436). The Jews of Prague also suffered from mob violence (1422) in this period. The unstable conditions in Prague compelled many Jews to emigrate.\n\nFollowing the legalization, at the end of the 15th century, of moneylending by non-Jews in Prague, the Jews of Prague lost the economic significance which they had held in the medieval city, and had to look for other occupations in commerce and crafts. The position of the Jews began to improve at the beginning of the 16th century, mainly owing to the assistance of the king and the nobility. The Jews found greater opportunities in trading commodities and monetary transactions with the nobility. As a consequence, their economic position improved. In 1522 there were about 600 Jews in Prague, but by 1541 they numbered about 1,200. At the same time the Jewish quarters were extended. At the end of the 15th century the Jews of Prague founded new communities.\n\nUnder pressure of the citizens, king Ferdinand I was compelled in 1541 to approve the expulsion of the Jews. The Jews had to leave Prague by 1543, but were allowed to return in 1545. In 1557 Ferdinand I once again, this time upon his own initiative, ordered the expulsion of the Jews from Prague. They had to leave the city by 1559. Only after the retirement of Ferdinand I from the government of Bohemia were the Jews allowed to return to Prague in 1562.\n\nThe favorable position of the Jewish community of Prague during the reign of Rudolf II is reflected also in the flourishing Jewish culture. Among illustrious rabbis who taught in Prague at that time were Judah Loew B. Bezalel (the \"maharal\"); Ephraim Solomon B. Aaron of Luntschitz; Isaiah B. Abraham ha-levi Horowitz, who taught in Prague from 1614 to 1621; and Yom Tov Lipmann Heller, who became chief rabbi in 1627 but was forced to leave in 1631. The chronicler and astronomer David Gans also lived there in this period. At the beginning of the 17th century about 6,000 Jews were living in Prague.\n\nIn 1648 the Jews of Prague distinguished themselves in the defense of the city against the invading swedes. In recognition of their acts of heroism the Emperor presented them with a special flag which is still preserved in the Altneuschul. Its design with a Swedish cap in the center of the Shield of David became the official emblem of the Prague Jewish community.\n\nAfter the thirty years' war, government policy was influenced by the church counter-reformation, and measures were taken to limit the Jews' means of earning a livelihood. A number of anti-Semitic resolutions and decrees were promulgated. Only the eldest son of every family was allowed to marry and found a family, the others having to remain single or leave Bohemia.\n\nIn 1680, more than 3,000 Jews in Prague died of the plague. Shortly afterward, in 1689, the Jewish quarter burned down, and over 300 Jewish houses and 11 synagogues were destroyed. The authorities initiated and partially implemented a project to transfer all the surviving Jews to the village of Lieben (Liben) north of Prague. Great excitement was aroused in 1694 by the murder trial of the father of Simon Abeles, a 12-year-old boy, who, it was alleged, had desired to be baptized and had been killed by his father. Simon was buried in the Tyn (Thein) church, the greatest and most celebrated cathedral of the old town of Prague. Concurrently with the religious incitement against the Jews an economic struggle was waged against them.\n\nThe anti-Jewish official policy reached its climax after the accession to the throne of Maria Theresa (1740-1780), who in 1744 issued an order expelling the Jews from Bohemia and Moravia. Jews were banished but were subsequently allowed to return after they promised to pay high taxes. In the baroque period noted rabbis were Simon Spira; Elias Spira; David Oppenheim; and Ezekiel Landau, chief rabbi and rosh yeshivah (1755-93(.\n\nThe position of the Jews greatly improved under Joseph II (1780-1790), who issued the Toleranzpatent of 1782. The new policy in regard to the Jews aimed at gradual abolition of the limitations imposed upon them, so that they could become more useful to the state in a modernized economic system. At the same time, the new regulations were part of the systematic policy of germanization pursued by Joseph II. Jews were compelled to adopt family names and to establish schools for secular studies; they became subject to military service, and were required to cease using Hebrew and Yiddish in business transactions. Wealthy and enterprising Jews made good use of the advantages of Joseph's reforms. Jews who founded manufacturing enterprises were allowed to settle outside the Jewish quarter of Prague.\n\nSubsequently the limitations imposed upon Jews were gradually removed. In 1841 the prohibition on Jews owning land was rescinded. In 1846 the Jewish tax was abolished. In 1848 Jews were granted equal rights, and by 1867 the process of legal emancipation had been completed. In 1852 the ghetto of Prague was abolished. Because of the unhygienic conditions in the former Jewish quarter the Prague municipality decided in 1896 to pull down the old quarter, with the exception of important historical sites. Thus the Altneuschul, the Pinkas and Klaus, Meisel and Hoch synagogues, and some other places of historical and artistic interest remained intact.\n\nIn 1848 the community of Prague, numbering over 10,000, was still one of the largest Jewish communities in Europe (Vienna then numbered only 4,000 Jews). In the following period of the emancipation and the post- emancipation era the Prague community increased considerably in numbers, but did not keep pace with the rapidly expanding new Jewish metropolitan centers in western, central, and Eastern Europe.\n\nAfter emancipation had been achieved in 1867, emigration from Prague abroad ceased as a mass phenomenon; movement to Vienna, Germany, and Western Europe continued. Jews were now represented in industry, especially the textile, clothing, leather, shoe, and food industries, in wholesale and retail trade, and in increasing numbers in the professions and as white-collar employees. Some Jewish bankers, industrialists and merchants achieved considerable wealth. The majority of Jews in Prague belonged to the middle class, but there also remained a substantial number of poor Jews.\n\nEmancipation brought in its wake a quiet process of secularization and assimilation. In the first decades of the 19th century Prague Jewry, which then still led its traditionalist orthodox way of life, had been disturbed by the activities of the followers of Jacob Frank. The situation changed in the second half of the century. The chief rabbinate was still occupied by outstanding scholars, like Solomon Judah Rapoport, the leader of the Haskalah movement; Markus Hirsch (1880-1889) helped to weaken the religious influence in the community. Many synagogues introduced modernized services, a shortened liturgy, the organ and mixed choir, but did not necessarily embrace the principles of the reform movement.\n\nJews availed themselves eagerly of the opportunities to give their children a higher secular education. Jews formed a considerable part of the German minority in Prague, and the majority adhered to liberal movements. David Kuh founded the \"German liberal party of Bohemia and represented it in the Bohemian diet (1862-1873). Despite strong Germanizing factors, many Jews adhered to the Czech language, and in the last two decades of the 19th century a Czech assimilationist movement developed which gained support from the continuing influx of Jews from the rural areas. Through the influence of German nationalists from the Sudeten districts anti-Semitism developed within the German population and opposed Jewish assimilation. At the end of the 19th century Zionism struck roots among the Jews of Bohemia, especially in Prague.\n\nGrowing secularization and assimilation led to an increase of mixed marriages and abandonment of Judaism. At the time of the Czechoslovak republic, established in 1918, many more people registered their dissociation of affiliation to the Jewish faith without adopting another. The proportion of mixed marriages in Bohemia was one of the highest in Europe. The seven communities of Prague were federated in the union of Jewish religious communities of greater Prague and cooperated on many issues. They established joint institutions; among these the most important was the institute for social welfare, established in 1935. The \"Afike Jehuda society for the Advancement of Jewish Studies\" was founded in 1869. There were also the Jewish museum and \"The Jewish historical society of Czechoslovakia\". A five-grade elementary school was established with Czech as the language of instruction. The many philanthropic institutions and associations included the Jewish care for the sick, the center for social welfare, the aid committee for refugees, the aid committee for Jews from Carpatho- Russia, orphanages, hostels for apprentices, old-age homes, a home for abandoned children, free-meal associations, associations for children's vacation centers, and funds to aid students. Zionist organizations were also well represented. There were three B'nai B'rith lodges, women's organizations, youth movements, student clubs, sports organizations, and a community center. Four Jewish weeklies were published in Prague (three Zionist; one Czech- assimilationist), and several monthlies and quarterlies. Most Jewish organizations in Czechoslovakia had their headquarters in Prague.\n\nJews first became politically active, and some of them prominent, within the German orbit. David Kuh and the president of the Jewish community, Arnold Rosenbacher, were among the leaders of the German Liberal party in the 19th century. Bruno Kafka and Ludwig Spiegel represented its successor in the Czechoslovak republic, the German Democratic Party, in the chamber of deputies and the senate respectively. Emil Strauss represented that party in the 1930s on the Prague Municipal Council and in the Bohemian diet. From the end of the 19th century an increasing number of Jews joined Czech parties, especially T. G. Masaryk's realists and the social democratic party. Among the latter Alfred Meissner, Lev Winter, and Robert Klein rose to prominence, the first two as ministers of justice and social welfare respectively.\n\nZionists, though a minority, soon became the most active element among the Jews of Prague. \"Barissia\" - Jewish Academic Corporation, was founded in Prague in 1903, it was one of the leading academic organizations for the advancement of Zionism in Bohemia. Before World War I the students' organization \"Bar Kochba\", under the leadership of Samuel Hugo Bergman, became one of the centers of cultural Zionism. The Prague Zionist Arthur Mahler was elected to the Austrian parliament in 1907, though as representative of an electoral district in Galicia. Under the leadership of Ludvik Singer the \"Jewish National Council\" was formed in 1918. Singer was elected in 1929 to the Czechoslovak parliament, and was succeeded after his death in 1931 by Angelo Goldstein. Singer, Goldstein, Frantisek Friedmann, and Jacob Reiss represented the Zionists on the Prague municipal council also. Some important Zionist conferences took place in Prague, among them the founding conference of hitachadut in 1920, and the\n18th Zionist congress in 1933.\n\nThe group of Prague German-Jewish authors which emerged in the 1880s, known as the \"Prague Circle\" ('der Prager Kreis'), achieved international recognition and included Franz Kafka, Max Brod, Franz Werfel, Oskar Baum, Ludwig Winder, Leo Perutz, Egon Erwin Kisch, Otto Klepetar, and Willy Haas.\n\nDuring the Holocaust period, the measures e.g., deprivation of property rights, prohibition against religious, cultural, or any other form of public activity, expulsion from the professions and from schools, a ban on the use of public transportation and the telephone, affected Prague Jews much more than those still living in the provinces. Jewish organizations provided social welfare and clandestinely continued the education of the youth and the training in languages and new vocations in preparation for emigration. The Palestine office in Prague, directed by Jacob Edelstein, enabled about 19,000 Jews to emigrate legally or otherwise until the end of 1939.\n\nIn March 1940, the Prague zentralstelle extended the area of its jurisdiction to include all of Bohemia and Moravia. In an attempt to obviate the deportation of the Jews to \"the east\", Jewish leaders, headed by Jacob Edelstein, proposed to the zentralstelle the establishment of a self- administered concentrated Jewish communal body; the Nazis eventually exploited this proposal in the establishment of a ghetto at Theresienstadt (Terezin). The Prague Jewish community was forced to provide the Nazis with lists of candidates for deportation and to ensure that they showed up at the assembly point and boarded deportation trains. In the period from October 6, 1941, to March 16, 1945, 46,067 Jews were deported from Prague to \"the east\" or to Theresienstadt. Two leading officials of the Jewish community, H. Bonn and Emil Kafka were dispatched to Mauthausen concentration camp and put to death after trying to slow down the pace of the deportations. The Nazis set up a treuhandstelle (\"trustee Office\") over evacuated Jewish apartments, furnishings, and possessions. This office sold these goods and forwarded the proceeds to the German winterhilfe (\"winter aid\"). The treuhandstelle ran as many as 54 warehouses, including 11 synagogues (as a result, none of the synagogues was destroyed). The zentralstelle brought Jewish religious articles from 153 Jewish communities to Prague on a proposal by Jewish scholars. This collection, including 5,400 religious objects, 24,500 prayer books, and 6,070 items of historical value the Nazis intended to utilize for a \"central museum of the defunct Jewish race\". Jewish historians engaged in the creation of the museum were deported to extermination camps just before the end of the war. Thus the Jewish museum had acquired at the end of the war one of the richest collections of Judaica in the world.\n\n\nPrague had a Jewish population of 10,338 in 1946, of whom 1,396 Jews had not been deported (mostly of mixed Jewish and Christian parentage); 227 Jews had gone underground; 4,986 returned from prisons, concentration camps, or Theresienstadt; 883 returned from Czechoslovak army units abroad; 613 were Czechoslovak Jewish emigres who returned; and 2,233 were Jews from Ruthenia (Carpatho-Ukraine), which had been ceded to the U.S.S.R. who decided to move to Czechoslovakia. The communist takeover of 1948 put an end to any attempt to revive the Jewish community and marked the beginning of a period of stagnation. By 1950 about half of the Jewish population had gone to Israel or immigrated to other countries. The Slansky trials and the officially promoted anti-Semitism had a destructive effect upon Jewish life. Nazi racism of the previous era was replaced by political and social discrimination. Most of the Jews of Prague were branded as \"class enemies of the working people\". During this\nPeriod (1951-1964) there was no possibility of Jewish emigration from the country. The assets belonging to the Jewish community had to be relinquished to the state. The charitable organizations were disbanded, and the budget of the community, provided by the state, was drastically reduced. The general anti-religious policy of the regime resulted in the cessation, for all practical purposes, of such Jewish religious activities as bar-mitzvah religious instruction and wedding ceremonies. In 1964 only two cantors and two ritual slaughterers were left. The liberalization of the regime during 1965-1968 held out new hope for a renewal of Jewish life in Prague.\n\nAt the end of March 1967 the president of \"The World Jewish Congress\", Nahum Goldmann, was able to visit Prague and give a lecture in the Jewish town hall. Among the Jewish youth many tended to identify with Judaism. Following the soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 there was an attempt to put an end to this trend, however the Jewish youth, organized since 1965, carried on with their Jewish cultural activities until 1972. In the late 6os the Jewish population of Prague numbered about 2,000.\n\nOn the walls of the Pinkas synagogue, which is part of the central Jewish museum in Prague, are engraved the names of 77,297 Jews from Bohemia and Moravia who were murdered by the Nazis in 1939-1945.\n\nIn 1997 some 6,000 Jews were living in the Czech Republic, most of them in Prague. The majority of the Jews of Prague were indeed elderly, but the Jewish community's strengthened in 1990's by many Jews, mainly American, who had come to work in the republic, settled in Prague, and joined the community.\n\nIn April 2000 the central square of Prague was named Franz Kafka square. This was done thanks to the unflinching efforts and after years of straggle with the authorities, of Professor Eduard Goldstucker, a Jew born in Prague, the initiator of the idea.", "He":

17th century through the 20th century, as well as a pre-burial house and monuments to Jewish soldiers. The cemetery is owned by the Jewish community of Brno, and can be accessed freely. \n\nHISTORY\n\nIt is believed that the first Jews settled in Miroslav after they were expelled from the Moravian royal cities in 1454. Records from the Ottoman-Hapsburg wars (16th-18th centuries) mention a Jewish community in the town. That community subsequently dwindled to only three families, but the population began to recover when it began absorbing refugees from the Chmielnicki Massacres (1648-1649). In 1666 there were 20 Jews who were expelled from the town. Jews from Vienna later settled in the town, bringing the town's total Jewish population to 18 families. Legally 119 Jewish families were permitted to live in Miroslav. \n\nIn 1753 there were 64 families living in 18 houses. By 1801 there were 448 Jews (18% of the total population) living in the town, a number that did not change by 1820. \n\nIn 1831 local Jewish resident Rafael Koenig (b. 1808) became the first Jewish locksmith in the Hapsburg Empire. \n\nA Reform-style synagogue was built in 1845. An independent Jewish political community was established in 1867; it was later incorporated into the municipality in 1924. \n\nThe Jewish population reached its peak in 1857, when it numbered 1,032 people. With the removal of residence restrictions after the 1848 emancipation of Jews throughout the Austrian Empire, many Jews began moving to larger towns and cities, seeking greater economic and educational opportunities and greatly reducing the populations of smaller towns and villages. The Jewish population of Miroslav subsequently declined to 424 in 1869, though it rose slightly, to 528 people, in 1900. During World War I approximately 350 refugees fled to Miroslav, but few settled there permanently. In 1930 the community numbered 291 people (6.6% of the total). \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nIn March, 1939 the region of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews living there. The Jewish community of Miroslav was sent to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto in 1942. From there they were deported to concentration and death camps, where most perished. Before the community was sent to Terezin, ritual objects and synagogue equipment from Miroslav was sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague.\n\nPOSTWAR\n\nMany of the buildings that stood in the Jewish Quarter were preserved. In 1999 students from the Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, the Netherlands, and Slovakia worked to restore the Jewish cemetery in Miroslav.

"Luka\n\nGerman: Luck\n\nA village and municipality, Liberec Region, Czech Republic\n\nAccording to tradition, Jews from Bavaria founded the town in the 11th century; there are local records of Jews living in the town in 1198. \n\nRecords from 1432 mention a Jewish \"place of worship.\" Later, in 1842, the synagogue and community records were damaged in a fire. \n\nDuring the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) the community was nearly decimated by the plague.\n \nThe Jews from Luka, like those from Hroznetin (German: Lichtenstadt), did business in nearby Carlsbad. \n\nDuring the 19th century Feibel (Phillip) Kohn served as the mayor for 28 years. A Reform and an Orthodox rabbi served the community.\n   \nIn 1848, Jews throughout the Austrian Empire, including Luka, were emancipated and residence and economic restrictions were subsequently lifted. As a result, many Jews throughout the region began moving to larger towns and cities, seeking greater economic and educational opportunities. In Luka, Jews had begun moving elsewhere even before 1848 and the emancipation served only to accelerate the community's decline. In 1850 there were 1,150 Jews lived in Luka (80% of the total population). By 1869 the population had dropped to 446. By 1930 there were not enough Jews living in Luka for a minyan.\n \nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nBy the time the Nazis invaded, few to no Jews were living in Luka. On November 10, 1938,the Nazis burned down the synagogue. They also sold tombstones from the Jewish cemetery to a stonemason.", "He": "\u05dc\u05d5\u05e7\u05d4 LUKA\r\n\r\n(\u05d1\u05d2\u05e8\u05de\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea:

Republic\n\nPilsen is located approximately 56 miles (90km) west of Prague. Until 1918 it was part of the Austrian Empire. During the interwar period, and between the end of World War II until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. \n\nTwo of Pilsen's five synagogues remain standing. The Moorish-style Great Synagogue, which was built in 1893, was renovated at the end of the 20th century. In addition to being used for religious services, it is also used as a concert and exhibition hall. Both the Great Synagogue and the Old Synagogue offer tours from April until October, Sunday through Friday (except for Jewish holidays).  \n\nThe Jewish cemetery has tombstones dating from the end of the 19th century through the 20th century. It includes a memorial to victims of the Holocaust, as well as special sections for children, refugees, and soldiers who served in World War I. The cemetery can be accessed freely. \n\nHISTORY\n\nThe Jewish community of Pilsen was one of the first to be established in Bohemia. The first documentary record of the community is a decree from 1338, signed by Charles IV, in which the town's administrators were ordered to protect the Jews. The community had a synagogue, and in 1432 the community bought a plot of land to be used as a cemetery. \n\nMany transactions between Jews and Christians are recorded on the town records from the 15th century, indicating that there was a great deal of commercial interaction between them. These peaceful times, however, would not last. In 1504 Jews were expelled from Pilsen after a host desecration charge. It was not until 1848, with the emancipation of Jews throughout the Austrian Empire and the subsequent removal of residence restrictions, that Jews were once again permitted to settle in Pilsen. \n\nIn the meantime, Jews were allowed to trade in Pilsen and Jews from all of western Bohemia and Prague attended the Pilsen markets. In 1821 there were 32 Jews living in Pilsen illegally. By 1854, once Jews were permitted to live in the city, the Jewish population jumped to 249. A Jewish cemetery was consecrated in 1856 and a synagogue in 1859. In spite of anti-Jewish riots that broke out in 1866, by 1870 the Jewish population had grown to 1,207. \n\nBy the beginning of the 20th century the community was among the five largest and most affluent in Bohemia. A large, Moorish-style synagogue was built in 1893. The first Bnai Brith lodge in Bohemia was founded in Pilsen. Beginning in 1918 the community supported two rabbis, one of whom delivered his sermons in Czech while the other gave his sermons in German. Ideologically the community was diverse, and conflicts would break out between German liberal assimilationists, Czech-Jews, and Zionists.\n\nControversy broke out during the interwar period of shechitah, kosher slaughtering. In 1920 it was declared illegal for humanitarian reasons. When the Supreme Court declared this prohibition illegal in 1934, the attempt to reintroduce shechitah failed because of the higher prices for kosher meat. \n\nIn 1921 there were 3,117 Jews living in Pilsen. In 1930 the community numbered 2,773 (2.4% of the total population). \n\nIn the fall of 1938 many Jews began arriving in Pilsen from communities in the Sudeten region, which was annexed to Nazi Germany following the Munich Agreement. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST \n\nIn March, 1939 the German army occupied Bohemia and Moravia, and declared the region as a protectorate of Nazi Germany. This ushered in a period of violence and discrimination against the region's Jews. The Jewish cemetery in Pilsen was desecrated; the synagogue would have been destroyed, but the plan was abandoned when it became clear that destroying the synagogue would also mean destroying the surrounding buildings. In 1940 the community's rabbi, Max Hoch, was killed, along with one of the community's leaders. In 1942 more than 2,000 people from western Bohemia were concentrated in Pilsen. From there they were deported to concentration and death camps, where most were killed. Meanwhile, ritual objects from the synagogue were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague.\n\nPOSTWAR\n\nAfter World War II a community was reestablished in Pilsen; in 1948 it consisted of 293 people.  A memorial for the 3,200 victims of the Polocaust from Pilsen and western Bohemia was dedicated in the new cemetery in 1951. Though the Jewish community declined, mainly due to emigration, it was still active in 1970 and used the old synagogue and maintained both cemeteries. It also administered the Ceske Budejovice community.\n\nIn 1973 the Great Synagogue, which had fallen into disrepair, was closed for safety reasons. It was reopened and restored in 1998.

Pozsony\n\nCapital of Slovakia. Part of Hungary until 1918\n\nBratislava was the chartered capital of the kings of Hungary. It was one of the most ancient and important Jewish centers in the Danube region. The first Jews probably arrived with the Roman legions, but the first documented evidence of their presence in the city dates from the 13th century. In 1291 the community was granted a charter by King Andrew the III and a synagogue is first mentioned in 1335.\n\nThe Jews of Bratislava mainly engaged in moneylending, but there were also merchants, artisans, vineyard owners, and vintners. The Jews were expelled from Hungary in 1360, but returned in 1367. In 1371 the municipality introduced the Judenbuch, which regulated financial dealings between Jews and Christians. \n\nMoney matters between Jews and Christians, however, could unexpectedly take complicated turns. King Sigismund granted Christians an exemption for the year 1392 from paying interest on loans borrowed from Jews. Later, in 1441 and 1450, all outstanding debts owed to Jews were cancelled, and in 1475 Jews were forbidden from accepting real estate as security. Ladislas II prevented Jews from attempting to leave Bratislava in 1506 by confiscating the property of those who had already left. This proved to be somewhat ironic since the Jews were eventually expelled from Bratislava, and Hungary as a whole, in 1526. Instead, the Jews began settling in the surrounding areas of Shlossberg and Zuckermandel. A Jewish community was not reestablished in Bratislava until the end of the seventeenth century when Samuel Oppenheimer resettled the city. He was followed by other Jews, some of whom were born locally and others who came from Vienna, which had expelled its Jews in 1670, Bohemia and Moravia, as well as a small number from Poland. A synagogue was built in 1695 where the first known rabbi to work there was Yom Tov Lipmann. In 1699 the court Jew Simon Michael, who had settled in Bratislava in 1693, was appointed as head of the community. He built a beit midrash and bought land to build a cemetery. \n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries the Jews of Bratislava were leaders in both the business and religious worlds. In business they were among the leaders of the textile trade, while the religious leader Rabbi Moses Sofer (better known as the Hatam Sofer) turned Bratislava into a center of Jewish life. The Hatam Sofer became a leader of Orthodoxy, and is perhaps best known for his (ironically radical) statement that \"He-hadash asur min haTorah,\" \"Innovation is forbidden according to the Torah.\" His status as a rabbi, teacher, scholar, rosh yeshiva, and halakhist was unparalleled. Upon his death his son, Avraham Shmuel Binyamin (otherwise known as the Ketav Sofer) and then his grandson Simcha Bumen, and his great-grandson Akiva succeeded him in turn. Other outstanding rabbis that served in the city before the Hatam Sofer were Moshe Harif of Lemberg, Akiva Eger (the elder), Yitzhak Landau of Kukla, Meir Barbi of Halberstadt, and Meshulam Igra of Tymenitsa. Each was an outstanding Talmudic scholar, and Landau and Barbi established large and prestigious yeshivas.  \n\nIn spite of the Hatam Sofer's uncompromising Orthodoxy, the Haskalah (Jewish Enlightenment) made important inroads, particularly among the wealthy merchants and intellectuals in the city. In 1820 those who were in favor of the Haskalah succeeded in establishing an elementary school that combined religious and secular studies. Shortly thereafter the community's Orthodox majority also built a Talmud Torah that combined religious and secular studies, under the supervision of the city's chief rabbi. \n\nThe community was also split during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. While those who were in favor of reform, led by Adolf Neustadt, enthusiastically supported the revolution, joining the National Guard and advocating for Jewish emancipation, the Orthodox leadership distanced themselves from these actions. Anti-Jewish riots subsequently broke out during the revolution around Easter; the Jews of Bratislava suffered the worst violence. While no Bratislavan Jews were killed, there were many who were severely beaten, and there was enormous damage done to property. The Jewish Quarter was placed under military protection, and Jews who lived elsewhere had to move within it. The violence prompted calls to emigrate to the US. \n\nThe Revolution of 1848 would not be the last time that the Jews of Bratislava were the victims of pogroms and anti-Jewish violence. 1850 saw more anti-Jewish riots around the holiday of Easter. Further outbreaks of anti-Jewish violence followed the Tiszaeszlar blood libel in 1882 and 1883, as well as after other blood libels in 1887 and 1889. \n\nTensions continued to grow between the Orthodox and the maskilim within the community. After 1869 the Orthodox, Neologist, and Status Quo Ante factions in Bratislava formed separate congregations. The Orthodox provincial office (Landseskanzlei) later became notorious for its opposition to Zionism. The Neolog and Status Quo Ante congregations united in 1928 as the Jeshurun Federation.\n\nJewish institutions in Bratislava included religious schools, charitable organizations, and a Jewish hospital. The Hungarian Zionist organization was founded in Bratislava in 1902, and the World Mizrachi Organization was founded in 1904; the latter sparked protests from over 100 rabbis. The first Hungarian Zionist Congress was held in Bratislava in March 1903 and the city became the Hungarian center for the Zionist Organization in Hungary. \n\nWith the establishment of Czechoslovakia, Bratislava also became the center of Agudas Yisroel in Czechoslovakia, in addition to remaining a Zionist center. Several Jewish newspapers and a Hebrew weekly, \"HaYehudi,\" were printed in the city. There were also over 300 Hebrew and Yiddish books printed in the city between 1831 and 1930. The Orthodox Jewish Communities of Slovakia was established in the city, enabling the Orthodox community to cut ties with Hungary.  \n\nThe German army occupied Czechoslovakia in March, 1938 and soon established an independent Slovak state. Even before the declaration of the independent state, there were attacks on the synagogue and yeshiva on November 11, 1938. Nearly 1,000 Jewish students were expelled from the university and anti-Jewish terror, restrictive measures, and pogroms increased. With the establishment of the Slovak state, Jews continued to suffer from discrimination. Akiva Shreiber and a number of his yeshiva students succeeded in leaving Bratislava for Palestine at the end of 1939.\n\nNonetheless, the Jewish population of Bratislava peaked in 1940 at 18,000 people (13% of the total population of the city). This was in spite of the fact that Jewish organizations, with the exception of religious communal activities, were prohibited from organizing activities. Additionally, Jews were evicted from various neighborhoods, Jewish students were expelled from public schools, and Jewish properties were confiscated. By the fall of 1941 about half of the city's population had been forcibly sent from the city to the provinces; by the summer of 1942 two-thirds of the Jews of Bratislava were sent to concentration or extermination camps. Gisi Fleischmann of WIZO and Mikhael Dov Ber Weissmandel began organizing an underground resistance movement. They contacted international Jewish organizations, in the hopes that they could save the Jews who remained in the city and the surrounding area. August 1944 saw a Slovak uprising, and the country was subsequently occupied by the Germans. At that point, the remaining Jews in Bratislava were deported. \n\nIn the end, approximately 13,000 Jews from Bratislava were killed during the Holocaust. After the war, the city was an important transit point for the thousands of displaced Jews who were making their way to other countries and began to rebuild. The Orthodox and Neolog communities united and maintained two cemetaries, a mikvah, a slaughterhouse, a soup kitchen, a matzah bakery, a Jewish hospital, an old age home, and a Jewish orphanage. Zionist activity resumed; HaShomer HaTzair and Bnei Akiva led activities for orphans preparing to emigrate to Mandate Palestine. Maccabi HaTzair and Beitar were also active. Though there was an attempt to reopen the Pressburg Yeshiva, it ultimately failed. \n\nAfter the communist takeover, thousands more Jews left the city, most of whom went to Israel. According to an agreement made with Israel, 4,000 Jews were permitted to leave and enter Israel at the end of the 1940s while 2,000 remained in Bratislava. In 1969 there were 1,500 Jews in the city. \n\nThe 1990s saw the opening of a number of memorials and places of Jewish interest. A Jewish cultural heritage museum was opened in the old Jewish Quarter. A memorial plaque was added to the Orthodox cemetery in memory of the 13,000 Jewish victims of Bratislava who were killed during the Holocaust. Additionally, in 1997 a monument commemorating the Slovakian Jewish victims of the Nazis was erected on the site where the Pressburg Yeshiva once stood. Jewish organizations and municipal authorities worked together to renovate and reopen the grave of the Hatam Sofer, among other rabbis, to the public. \n\nIn the year 2000 there were 800 Jews living in Bratislava.

AFTER THE BATTLE OF MOHACS (1526), JEWS WERE PROHIBITED FROM SETTLING IN THE TOWN, BUT WERE LIVING IN NEIGHBORING VILLAGES. IN THE 17TH AND 18TH CENTURIES THE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED ON THE JEWS IN MORAVIA, SUCH AS THE PROHIBITION ON MARRIAGE, LED MANY TO MOVE TO NORTHERN HUNGARY, SOME OF WHOM SETTLED IN TRENCIN, IN PARTICULAR FROM UHERSKY BROD. THESE SETTLERS REMAINED AFFILIATED TO UHERSKY BROD FOR ABOUT A CENTURY. AN ORGANIZED COMMUNITY WAS ESTABLISHED ABOUT 1760; ITS FIRST RABBI, DAVID KOHN CHASSID (D. 1783), WAS BURIED IN THE ALREADY EXISTING JEWISH CEMETERY. THE TAX ROSTER OF 1787 CONTAINS THE NAMES OF 82 HEADS OF FAMILIES IN THE CITY OF TRENCIN AND 660 MORE IN THE COUNTY. THE FIRST SYNAGOGUE WAS REPLACED BY AN IMPOSING NEW EDIFICE IN 1913. A GERMAN- LANGUAGE JEWISH SCHOOL WAS FOUNDED IN 1857. THE COMMUNITY GREW\r\nRAPIDLY, AND AFTER WORLD WAR I CONTINUED TO GAIN IMPORTANCE IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA. IT MAINTAINED A NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONS, AND ZIONIST GROUPS WERE ACTIVE, MAINLY AMONG THE YOUTH. NOTED PERSONALITIES ORIGINATING FROM TRENCIN WERE IGNAZ SZEGHO, JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF HUNGARY; MARKUS KORANYI, DIRECTOR OF THE ROTHSCHILD HOSPITAL IN VIENNA; IGNAZ ZIEGLER, RABBI OF KARLSBAD, AND BENJAMIN FISCHER, ORTHODOX RABBI IN BUDAPEST.\r\n\r\nTHERE WERE ABOUT 2,500 JEWS LIVING IN TRENCIN IN 1940. MOST OF THEM WERE DEPORTED TO CONCENTRATION CAMPS. AFTER THE WAR SOME 300 TO 400 RETURNED FROM THE CAMPS OR FROM FORESTS WHERE THEY HAD BEEN IN HIDING. THE MAJORITY SUBSEQUENTLY EMIGRATED TO ISRAEL OR OTHER COUNTRIES OR MOVED TO LARGER CITIES. AFTER THE SOVIET INVASION IN 1968, MOST OF THE FEW WHO HAD REMAINED LEFT FOR THE WEST. IN 1971 THERE WERE A FEW JEWISH FAMILIES IN TRENCIN WHO OBSERVED THE MAIN JEWISH FESTIVALS AND BURIED THEIR DEAD ACCORDING TO JEWISH RITUAL.", "He": "\u05d8\u05e8\u05e0\u05e6'\u05d9\u05df

(1884-1968)\n\nAuthor and composer. Born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, Brod studied law and graduated in 1907 from the German University in Prague. \n\nHe was active in the Zionist movement from 1910 onwards and in 1918 he co-founded the National Council of the Jews of Czechoslovakia and was elected its vice president. He worked for the Czech government until 1924. \n\nBrod gradually began to focus his interests on literature and served as the theatre and music critic for the Prager Tagblatt between 1924-1939. At the same time he began developing his writing career. \n\nIn 1939 Brod fled to Eretz Israel, where he settled in Tel Aviv. From the time of his immigration until his death, he served as the artistic adviser of Habimah National Theatre and as music critic for Yedioth Chadashoth, a German language daily published in Tel Aviv.\n\nBrod is author of many writings including the philosophical work Heidentum, Christentum, Judentum (1921), twenty novels (including Der Frau, nach der man sich sehnt, 1927, and Tycho Brahes Weg zu Gott, 1916), plays (including Die Koenigin Esther, 1918, Die Faelscher, 1920), biographies (including Franz Kafka, Leos Janacek, 1924-25, and the composer and Brod\u2019s own piano teacher, Adolph Schreiber) and an autobiography (1960). \n\nHe also arranged for publication of Kafka\u2019s writings.

Born in Kalischt, Bohemia, (the former Austro-Hungarian Empire) in 1875 he was sent to study music in Vienna at the Conservatory and with Anton Bruckner. From 1880 he rose through positions in Kassel (1883), Prague, Leipzig (second to Arthur Nikisch), Budapest (1888) and Hamburg (1891) to become director of the Vienna Court Opera in 1897. In order to secure this position Mahler had to convert to Catholicism. Between 1898-1901 he also directed the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. His tenure in Vienna brought the opera to artistic achievements previously unknown. At the core of the repertoire he put Mozart\u2019s and Wagner\u2019s operas. Mahler resigned in 1907 because of serious intrigues. He became guest conductor at the Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1909 he was appointed director of the Philharmonic Society. Mahler tried to free himself from traditional performances and devote himself to the precise clarification of the works' sense and content. He often undertook corrections of the scores he conducted.\nThroughout the years Mahler adopted a work pattern: composing during summer vacations and rehearsing his compositions in the autumn. Even though his major occupation was conducting operas, he was a composer devoted to symphony and Lied. He composed 9 symphonies and left a draft of the tenth. He wrote songs and song cycles for voice and piano from German medieval and contemporary literature, among them LIEDER EINES FAHRENDEN GESELLEN (1883-1885) and KINDERTOTENLIEDER (1901-1904, both cycles for voice and orchestra). His \u201csymphony in songs\u201d DAS LIED VON DER ERDE (1907/08) is based on six songs from Chinese Flute by Hans Bethge, written for voice and large orchestra.

city in 1243 and until 1640 served alternately with Olomouc as the capital of Moravia. Between 1640-1948 Brno was the sole capital. Brno was the second largest city in Czechoslovakia. It was a cultural, commercial and industrial centre for textiles, automobiles, railroad-cars, munitions (Bren machine-guns) and clothing. In the city ancient churches from the 14th century and the remains of an old fort still exist. Brno was known for its educational institutions in the German and Czech languages. Until 1918 the city was under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian empire and since then until 1993 a part of the Czechoslovak Republic.\n\nIn 1254, Ottokar Przemysl II king of Moravia invited Jews to settle in Brno and granted them a letter of privileges.\n\nIn the middle of the 14th century, there were 1,000 Jews in a special quarter of the city which one could enter only through the \"Jews gate\". At the head of the Jewish autonomous community was the \"Parnas\" who represented the Jews before the city and provincial authorities. The community institutions were financed by the taxes of its members. The community also paid a \"Jewish tax\" to the local authorities.\n\nAs early as 1378 there was a Jewish school in the city. In the first half of the 15th century  Israel Bruneh officiated as rabbi.\n\nDuring the period of the Hussite wars 1419-1436 the hatred against Jews increased causing the deaths of thousands of Jews and the destruction of many Jewish communities in Bohemia and Moravia, among them Brno.\n\nOn November 11, 1454, King Ladislav Posthumus expelled the Jews of the city and gave the Jewish homes to the townspeople.\n\nFor 400 years Jews were forbidden to live within the city walls. Only a few court Jews were allowed there. Jews who came to Brno could spend the night only in the suburb Kroena where a Jewish inn with a kosher kitchen had been established in 1660. The guests at the inn were forbidden to hold public prayer services, to go out at night or have any social contact with the local population. Only commercial relationships were permitted. In 1769 Jacov Dobrushka who leased the inn needed a special permit to pray in his home and keep a Torah scroll there. Jacob Frank, the founder of the Frankist movement and a relative of Dobrushka came to the city in 1773 and was active there until 1786.\n\nAt the beginning of the 18th century there were 52 Jews who lived in the city illegally. In 1722, the city authorities allowed the chief Parnas of the Jews of Moravia to live near the city gate.\n\nThe \"family law\" passed in 1726 by Emperor Karl VI which limited the number of Jews in Moravian cities and the head-taxes levied by queen Maria Theresa in 1744 were hard on the Jews of Moravia. An improvement in their condition came as a result of the \"toleration edict\" passed in 1782 by Emperor Joseph II, which allowed Jews to open schools, obtain higher education and work as artisans. The city municipal council appealed against the edict. The Jews of Brno attained these privileges only after some years. In 1797, 12 Jews lived in the city and 113 in the suburbs. In 1804 the number had increased to 199. In 1834 there were 135 Jews in the city. The total population was 17,262.\n\nIn 1848 the Jews attained equal civil rights. The community began to organize its institutions. In 1852 a burial society was founded, permission was granted to appoint a rabbi and consecrate a cemetery. The first rabbi of the renewed community was David Ashkenazi, who still worked ostensibly as \"meat inspector\". The synagogue was founded in 1853. The prayer-house was established in 1883 and enlarged afterwards. In 1906 a new synagogue was built.\n\nIn 1857 there were 2230 Jews among a population of 59,819.\n\nIn 1859 the community was officially recognized. In 1860 Heinrich Kafka was chosen president of the community. Dr. Baruch Placzek was rabbi and during the period 1884-1922 he also served as chief rabbi of the country. A cantor also served the community. In 1861 the constitution of the community was approved by the authorities and a Jewish school with German as the language of instruction was opened. 77 boys and 76 girls studied there. In 1880 a ritual bath and a Matzoth factory were Bnei Brith chapter, a fraternity \"Societa\" for social services, a group to support yeshiva scholars and the \"Hort\" organization whose members were business men and clerks were founded. In 1890 the number of Jews in the city rose to 7,087.\n\nDuring World War I the community helped about 16,000 Jewish refugees who had come to the city from Galicia and Bukovina and also helped the Jewish soldiers stationed in the area. \nSome of the refugees remained in the city after the war.\n\nDuring the period of the Czechoslovak Republic (1918-1938) a new community council was chosen, a Jewish elementary school with five classes and a Jewish reformed science high school with eight classes (the only one in western Czechoslovakia) were opened. At first the language of instruction was German, later on Czech. Jewish students, many from Eastern Europe where they could not get an academic education because of Numerus Clausus (a law limiting the percentage of Jewish students) came to study in the institutions for higher learning in Brno.\n\nIn 1922 there were 10,668 Jews in the city. The leaders of the community were Rabbi Dr. Ludwig Levi and Shmuel Beran the president. In 1931, the president of the community was the industrialist Julius Zwicker.\n\nDuring the 13th century, the Jews who settled in Brno enjoyed trading rights equal to those of the Christians and could buy houses and land.\n\nAfter the expulsion in 1454 every Jewish merchant who tried to trade in the city markets was punished. Only in the 16th century were Jews allowed to trade there after payment of double taxes and only twice a week, in spite of the revenue they brought to the city coffers.\n\nDuring the Thirty Years War which broke out in 1618, the Jews were the purveyers for the Kaiser's army and helped the cities by granting them loans. The guilds and townspeople opposed granting the Jews additional privileges in return.\n\nIn 1753 Franz Joseph Neuman was granted permission to establish a Hebrew printing press and in 1765 Jews leased tobacco farms and a textile factory. After 1860 when Jews of Moravia were allowed to purchase real estate the development of trade and industry was rapid. Jews were prominent industrialists. They were also active in medicine, architecture, engineering, banking and other fields. World War I affected the economic conditions of the Jews adversely but during the period of the Czechoslovak Republic the community prospered once again.\n\nIn Brno there were well-known Jewish artists, the poet Hieronymus Lorm, the writers Philip Langmen, Oscar Jelinik and Felix Langer, the singers Caroline Giperz and Leopold Demuth, the musicologist Paul Stephan, the violinist Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst and the composers Pavel Hass and Hans Shimring. Dr. Adolph Frankel of Brno was a theatre manager.\n\nFrom the beginning of their settlement in the city, the Jews were faced by the enmity of the town's people. The church at times incited outbursts of violence, like the pogroms which followed the black plague in 1348. Even after the Jews were given equal rights with the gentiles there were manifestations of anti-Semitism. Only in the second half of the 19th century there was an improvement in the status of the Jews in Christian society.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century Zionist societies were organized (\"Theodor Herzl\" \"Zion\" \"Emuna\" (from which Poalei Zion developed afterwards) and \"Zfira\". The students society \"Veritas\" spread the Zionist ideology, helped found a students hostel, and organized a \"Jewish Soldiers Council\" fearing anti-Semitic activities as a result of the declaration of the Czechoslovak Republic. This group later founded the Jewish peoples council in Brno (the Moravian chapter of the National Jewish Council founded in Prague in 1918.) The Czechoslovak Republic in the period between the two world wars granted the Jews national cultural autonomy. The \"Juedische Akademische Lese Und Rede Halle\" was founded in Brno. Many Jewish students from the provincial towns and neighboring countries were active within this framework.\n\nThe Jews of Brno were also active in political affairs. Dr Adolph Stranski was a member of the Austrian parliament and during the period of the Republic was a member of the senate. His son, Yaroslav Stranski was minister of justice in the Czech government in exile in London during World War II and during the years 1945-48 was minister of education.\n\nDr. Ludwig Czech was vice-chairman of the German social-democratic party for 18 years and served in turn as minister of social welfare, minister of public works and minister of health. Johann Pollack was a member of the senate. Ziegfried Taub was a member of parliament. Dr. Czech and Johann Pollach were killed in the Terezin ghetto.\n\nIn the municipal council elections held in 1919 one representative of the Poalei Zion was elected and three of the Jewish national list.\n\nIn 1921 the headquarters of the federation of Zionist organizations was established in Brno. Dr. Alfred Engel and Dr. Adolf Greenfeld of Brno were on the central committee.\n\nBranches of \"Hitachdut\", \"Hamizrahi\", \"Revisionist Zionist\", \"Wizo\" (from 1934) and \"General Zionists\" (from 1934) were active in the city. \"Poalei Zion\" opened a branch in 1921 and Siegfried Spitz of Brno was head of the youth department in all of Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe Zionist youth movements, \"Hashomer Hazair\", \"Tchelet Lavan\", \"Maccabi Hazair\" and \"Bnei Akiva\" competed in efforts to gain members. A Jewish sport club was active in Brno from 1907. From 1924, Brno was the regional centre of Maccabi and the centre of Bar-Kochba in Moravia and Silesia. In 1927 Dr. Karl Sonnenfeld of Brno was vice-president of world Maccabi. In 1931, five Jews from Brno were members of the central committee of the newly-founded Jewish party.\n\nAmong the Jewish weeklies in the city were the \"Juedische Volksstimme (voice of the Jewish People) published by Max Hickl and \"Juedische Sozialist\" (the Jewish socialist) and \"Der Neue Weg\" (the new way) by Hugo Gold.\n\nIn 1938 there were 11,003 Jews in the city.\n\n\nThe Holocaust Period\nAfter the annexation of Austria to Germany (March 1938) many Jewish refugees arrived in Brno and were in need of help from the community. In September 1938 a year before the outbreak of World War II the Czechoslovak Republic was dissolved as a result of the Munich pact. At the end of 1938 more than 1,000 Jews emigrated to Eretz Israel, most of them illegally, only a few had valid certificates.\n\nOn March 15, 1939 the German army occupied the Czech lands (Bohemia and Moravia) and the country became a protectorate of the Third Reich. The main synagogue in Brno was wrecked that same day and the small synagogue bombed afterwards. A few days later the jails of the Gestapo were filled with Jewish prisoners who were then sent to the concentration camp Mauthausen.\n\nOn October 1, there were only 9.726 Jews in the city. At the end of 1939, the Germans forbade Jewish emigration. The fascist rule removed the Jews step by step from the cultural, social and economic life. At the beginning of October 1941 there were 11,102 Jews in the city. A short time later the systematic transfer of Czech Jews into ghettos and death camps began. On November 18, 1941 the first transport of 1,000 men, women and children was sent to Minsk in Belorussia. Many died there within two weeks because of shortages of water and medicines. The weak were taken outside the ghetto and shot to death or murdered in special gas-trucks. The bodies were thrown into a pit in the nearby forest. From this transport only eleven Jews survived.\n\nBetween December 2, 1941 and July 1, 1943 9,064 Jews in eleven transports arrived in Terezin. Some died there but most of them were killed in the death camps in Poland especially Auschwitz. Only 684 Jews survived. Jews married to gentiles were left in the city. They were deported in 1945 but most of them survived.\n\nMany Jews from Brno served on the eastern front in the framework of the Czech units of the red army.\n\nAfter the liberation of the city by the Red Army, and until April 30, 1945, 804 survivors returned to the city. They renewed the activities of the community, repaired the orthodox synagogue and opened an old- age home. Dr. Richard Feder was appointed rabbi.  A chazan was also employed. The community provided services for the Jews of Kyjov, Olomouc and Ostrava. In 1969 rabbi Feder also served as chief rabbi of Moravia and Bohemia. In 1948 there were 1,398 Jews in the community. During the fifties a memorial was erected for the victims of the Holocaust. During that period the number of Jews in the city and its environs declined to 900.\n\nAs a result of the Russian invasion in 1698 most of the Jews left the city but returned afterwards. In 1969 there were 700 Jews there.\n\nIn 1973 about 500 Jews were registered in the community. The total population of the city was 330,000. The number of Jews in the city not registered in the community is not known.\n\nBy the early 2000s the number had dropoped to slightly less than 300. the community was responsible for the management of 10 synagogues and 45 cemeteries throughout Moravia, including restoration work.", "He": "\u05d1\u05e8\u05e0\u05d5 BRNO\r\n\r\n(\u05d1\u05d2\u05e8\u05de\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea

Franz (1883-1924), author, born to a middle class family in Prague, Bohemia (then part of Austria-Hungary, now in the Czech Republic)\n\nKafka was a lonely child. He studied at a German high school and then at university, becoming a doctor of law. He found positions in insurance companies, where he worked long hours and eventually had to resign owing to poor health. \n\nFrom 1917 he suffered from tuberculosis and much of his life from then on was spent in Sanatoriums. He was buried in the family tomb in Prague. \n\nOnly a few of his works - and not his best known - were published during his lifetime and he left instructions to his friend and literary executor, Max Brod, to burn the remainder. \n\nBrod disobeyed and the publication of his novels brought Kafka posthumous world fame.

A Jew is mentioned in a document of 1445. \nThe Jewish community, founded by people expelled from nearby Olomouc/Olmuetz in 1454, was since the 17th to the 19th century, second only to Mikulov (Nikolsburg) among the communities of Moravia. \nThe Jews dealt in luxury goods and locally made textiles. In 1584 the Jews' right of residence was confirmed but the branches of trade open to them were restricted. The community then numbered 31 families. A minute book (\"Pinkas\") opened in 1587 began with the \"Takkanot\" of Judah Loew Ben Bezalel regulating synagogal arrangements. A compendium of Sabbath hymns, Kol Simchah, was printed in 1602 by a short-lived local printing house.\n\nThe Jewish community and its importance in local industry increased after the protestant inhabitants had left when the town became Roman Catholic under duress. In 1639 there were 143 Jewish men in Prostejov and 64 houses in the town were owned by Jews. Prostejov absorbed many refugees after the Chmielnicki massacres in 1648 and the Vienna expulsion in 1670. The community numbered 64 families in 1669. The synagogue was dedicated in 1676. \nThe first-known rabbi was Isaac Chayyut Ben Abraham (d. 1639); among his successors were Meir Ben Isaac Ashkenazi and Wolf Boskowitz. The Prostejov rabbinate was a stepping-stone to the office of Landrabbiner for Menahem Krochmal and Nahum Trebitsch. A compromise reached in 1677 (and supplemented in 1688) concerning the extent of trade between Jews and gentiles testifies to the importance of Jewish participation in the textile and clothing trades. The community numbered 318 families in 1713, 1,393 persons in 1787, and 1,495 in 1798. The number of families allotted under the familiants law was 328. \nThe Prostejov community was strongly influenced by the Shabbatean movement, and one of its leaders, Judah Leib Prossnitz, lived in the town. The community was also affected by Frankism and was one of the first to absorb the ideas of the Haskalah. The first sermon in German in the Hapsburg dominions was preached there by Loew Schwab (1835). In 1843 a Jew founded a private elementary school for Jewish and Christian children. In 1831 Feith Ehrenstamm founded a factory, the beginning of Jewish enterprise in modern textile industry. By 1842 there were 135 Jewish textile merchants in Prostejov. The first factory for ready-made clothes on the European continent was founded by Mayer and Isaac Mandel in 1859. The 200 Jews in the national guard units were lauded for their conduct in fighting during the Anti-Jewish riots in 1848. Prostejov became a political community (Politische Gemeinde) in 1849. In 1880 there were 1,804 Jews in Prostejov.\nThe community absorbed many World War I refugees from eastern Europe. Between the two World Wars the community was one of the most active in Czechoslovakia and the first to arrange modern Hebrew courses. The clothing industry, represented mainly by the Sborowitz firm, which had 108 sales establishments throughout Czechoslovakia and a vast export business, brought affluence to the community which attracted many new members from sub- Carpathian Ruthenia (Carpatho-Russia). In 1930 the community numbered 1,442 (4.3% of the total).\n\nAmong the natives of the town were Menahem Katz, rabbi of the Deutschkreutz community and leader of Hungarian orthodoxy, Gideon Brecher, physician and author of a booklet on circumcision, his son Adolph, author and physician, and the bibliographer Moritz Steinschneider. Jonathan Eybeschuetz and Adolf and Hermann Jellinek were among the pupils of the Prostejov Yeshivah.\n\nMany refugees from the Sudeten area arrived in Prostejov in autumn 1938. After the German invasion (March 1939) Jews suffered from Gestapo raids, mainly in July when the synagogue also was closed. Many Jews left Prostejov during 1940. Those who remained were deported to the Nazi extermination camps in 1942. The synagogue appurtenances were transferred to the Jewish Central Museum in Prague. \n\nIn 1945 a small congregation administered by the Olomouc community was reestablished, mostly by Jews from sub-Carpathian Ruthenia. A memorial to the victims of the Holocaust was consecrated in 1950. \nThe congregation was still active in 1969.\n", "He": "\u05e4\u05e8\u05d5\u05e1\u05d8\u05d9\u05d5\u05d1

The Jewish cemetery, which saw its last local burial in 1870 and its final burial in 1915, still existed and could be visited as of 2013. The remaining tombstones are inscribed in Hebrew and/or German. \n\nHISTORY\n\nArnoltov is located 5 miles (8km) southwest of the district town of Sokolov (German: Falkenen), 10 miles (16km) from the town of Cheb (German: Eger), and 10 miles (16km) from the German border. The village is surrounded by woods. Most of its inhabitants worked as farmers, cattle-growers, and in forestry. Until 1918, Arnoltov was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; after World War I it became part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. \n\nThe Jewish community of Arnoltov was mentioned in a document from 1664, making it the oldest in the area. The Jews of Arnoltov were affiliated with the community of Kynsperk (German: Koenigsberg), which had a rabbi, a synagogue, and a cemetery. Over time, more Jews settled in Arnoltov and in the 18th century they were able to establish their own cemetery and community institutions. \n\nIn 1841 there were about 20 Jewish families living in the village, working mostly as traders in leather, furs, feathers, haberdashery, and old clothes. Eleven houses were owned by Jews, which were located next to each other in the village center. The prayer house was located in one of these houses. \n\nFollowing the emancipation of the Jews of Bohemia in 1848 and the consequent removal of settlement restrictions, Jews throughout the area began leaving villages for larger towns and cities. Arnoltov was no exception to this trend; many Jews from the village left for Prague and Vienna. The last local burial that took place at the Jewish cemetery in Arnoltov was in 1870 (a refugee from Galicia would be buried there in 1915); by 1890 there were no more Jews living in the village.

"As\n\nGerman: Asch\n\nThe westernmost town in the Czech Republic. Located in the Cheb (German: Eger) district, Karlovy Vary region, West Bohemia, Czech Republic\n\nAs is located approximately 30 miles (48km) west of the town of Karlovy-Vary (German: Karlsbad). Until 1918 the region was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; after World War I and until 1933 it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. \n\nA small number of Jews were permitted to settle in As during the middle of the 19th century; they would soon be granted civil rights, along with the rest of the Jews of Bohemia, in 1848. This small community was not autonomous and was affiliated with the nearby community of Frantiskovy Lazne. Most Jews in As worked as manufacturers in gloves and other textile goods, while others were shopkeepers or traded in sugar, coal, and horses. \n\nDuring World War I (1914-1918) many Jewish refugees from the town of Halic in Poland arrived in As, where they established an Orthodox prayer house in a private home. After the war, with the establishment of the Republic of Czechoslovakia following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Jews were granted cultural and national autonomy; however, many of the Jews of As did not ultimately choose to declare their nationality as Jewish and both linguistically and nationally tended to identify with Germany. In 1921 there were 51 Jews living in As, only two of whom declared themselves as Jewish nationals; the others declared themselves as German. In 1930 there were 64 Jews recorded as living in As; this time nine declared their nationality as Jewish. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nThe town of As, along with the rest of the region, was annexed to the German Third Reich in September, 1939. The Jews living in the town were expelled to Bohemia and Moravia, which by March had become a protectorate of Nazi Germany. The Jews were gradually deprived of their civil rights, and were ultimately concentrated in the Terezin Ghetto at the end of 1941. Some died there, but the majority of the Jews were sent to concentration and extermination camps throughout Poland and Germany, where they were killed.\n\nPOSTWAR\n\nIn 1946 all of the Germans living in Czechoslovakia, including those living in As, were expelled from the country. Among the new inhabitants who moved into the town were Jews from Carpatho-Russia and ex-soldiers of the Czech Army who served in the Red Army. They formed a community of 70 members and a prayer house was established in a private home. Additionally, between 1945 and 1946 a transit camp for Jewish refugees from Poland was established in As, where Jews were transferred from the area to displaced persons camps in Germany. Of the original Jews from As only 5 survived the war. They subsequently emigrated to the United States.

District, Czech Republic\n\nThe Jewish cemetery is located not far from the town. Though it was established during the second half of the 15th century (see below), the oldest legible gravestone dates to 1715. The cemetery is owned by the Brno Jewish community, which funds its upkeep. \n\nThe synagogue building from the 1825 renovation was repurposed after World War II since there was no longer a local Jewish community to use it. Between 1958 and 1974 it housed the Czechoslovak Hussite Church. It was later used by the local Gardeners' Association. \n\nIn 1995 a monument was erected to commemorate the 41 Jews from Batelov that were killed during the Holocaust. \n\nHISTORY\n\nBatelov was probably established during the 13th century. The town lies on the Jihlava River, close to Bohemia. Until 1918 the area was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; with the collapse of the empire after World War I the region became part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia until 1993. \n\nEvidence suggests that a Jewish community existed in Batelov during the first half of the 15th century, given that a cemetery was founded in the town during the second half of the 15th century. About 25 Jewish families lived under the protection of the nobles of the House of Blandenstein and relations with their Czech neighbors were good. \n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries the number of Jews living in Batelov reached 190. They lived in a Jewish Quarter located east of the central square. A number of narrow alleys, containing a total of 15 houses, branched out from a small plaza. Most of these houses were burned down in a fire that broke out in 1790. Among the buildings that were destroyed was the synagogue, which was rebuilt in 1794. \n\nDaily services were held in the synagogue, which was renovated in the Classicist style in 1825. According to the records of Rabbi Asher Adam Antscherl, 122 men attended High Holiday services in 1827; by World War I, before the population of Batelov began to decline, the synagogue was filled to capacity on holidays (in 1927, once the community's population began to decline, there were only 25 Jews who consistently came to services at the synagogue). At the beginning of the 19th century the Jews dug a well in the square of their quarter close to the community office and the mikvah. This well ultimately ended up supplying water to the entire area. \n\nUntil 1850, when the Jews of Batelov appointed their own rabbi, the community was under the leadership of the rabbinate of Trest (German: Triesch). Rabbi Shimon Frankenstein was the first rabbi of the community, and served in Batelov until 1888. He also taught at the local Jewish school, which placed a particular emphasis on Hebrew-language learning. In addition to a synagogue, a mikvah, and a Jewish school, the community also had a chevra kadisha. \n\nA number of well-known cantors and industrialists came from Batelov, in addition to the painter Gustav Boehm, and the economist Herman Antscherl. \n\nBy 1930 there were only 31 Jews remaining in Batelov.\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nAlmost a year before the outbreak of World War II, following the Munich Agreement (September 1938), the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved. In March 1939 Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of the Third Reich, beginning a period of discrimination against the Jews in the area. By 1942 the Jews of the protectorate were concentrated in the Terezin Ghetto. From there they were deported to a number of concentration and death camps, where most were killed. \n\nAfter World War II there were no more Jews living in Batelov.

cemetery, with tombstones dating from the 17th through the 20th centuries was repaired during the 1990s. Approximately 250 tombstones are still standing, with inscriptions in Hebrew, German, and Czech. The oldest legible tombstone dates to 1687. The cemetery is owned by the Jewish community of Praha (Prague) which pays for its maintenance. The houses on Siroka Street, the center of Jewish life in the town, are still standing, though they no longer house Jews. A building that once housed a synagogue on Siroka Street has been home to a fire museum in 1973. \n\nHISTORY\n\nThere are legends of a Rabbi Chaim who lived in Bechyne during the 16th century, indicating that there may have been a Jewish presence in the town during that time. Additionally, five Jewish taxpayers from Bechyne are mentioned in 1570. \n\nBy the 17th century there were enough Jews living in Bechyne that a cemetery was founded. The community also began having problems with the local Jewish and non-Jewish communities; in 1685 representatives of Bohemian Jewry complained that the community of Bechyne had failed to comply with its ordinances and in 1695 the Jews were prohibited from living in the same buildings as Christians. \n\nIn 1715 there were 81 Jews living in Bechyne (14 families living in 6 houses). By 1725 there were 56 people in the community. In 1902 there were 145 Jews living in Bechyne, which dropped to 39 in 1929 before rising slightly to 47 in 1930. During World War II the Jewish community was deported to Terezin, before being transported to concentration and death camps in Poland.

situated in an agricultural area, on a railway junction, 40 kms south-east of Prague. The town was founded in the first half of the 14th century. It has a castle of the prince, built in the 14th century, a gothic church, and the remains of a monastery of the 13th century. Benesov is also famous for its rose gardens and its horse racing events. Until 1918 the town belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire and later to the republic of Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe Jewish community of Benesov is first mentioned in 1419 and it is one of the oldest in the princely towns of Bohemia. Five Jewish families lived there in 1570 and in the 18th century the town already had a Jewish community. No evidence is available as to the development of the community but it is mentioned in the records of the neighboring communities Neveklov and Divizov. Until the emancipation of the Jews of Bohemia in 1848, these three communities formed a single unit centered in Benesov, and they had common organizations. The synagogue of Benesov was built in 1845 and in 1852 there lived in the place only seven Jewish families. In 1893 the community was officially recognized. At that time 786 Jews were registered in the community, including the Jews who lived at 27 other settlements in the sub district.\n\nThe community had a \"Hevra Kaddisha\" and a women\u2019s charity society.\n\nIn 1922 the community was headed by the rabbi Dr. Ottakar Kraus and Dr. Julius Taussig, the chairman. 400 Jews were then registered in the community, of whom 184 were entitled to vote and 106 paid taxes.\n\nBenesov was the center of the Jewish-Czech movement (\"Svaz Cechu-Zidu\"). The movement fostered the Czech language and culture and already at the end of the 19th century the town\u2019s Jews led the struggle against the local German school.\n\nIn the republic of Czechoslovakia, between the two world wars, the Jews enjoyed a national-cultural autonomy and Zionist activity started at Benesov. In 1926, towards the elections to the 15th Zionist congress, the local Jews acquired 27 shekels (membership and voting rights). In the census of 1930 some 10% of the Jews of Benesov declared their nationality as Jewish. A few of the local Zionist youth immigrated to Eretz Israel.\n\nIn 1930 237 Jews were living at Benesov (2.8% of the total population).\n\nFollowing the Munich agreement, about a year before the outbreak of World War II (1 September 1939), the republic of Czechoslovakia was dismembered. On the 15th of March 1939 the German army entered the Czech lands (Bohemia and Moravia) and the country became a protectorate of Nazi Germany. Shortly after the occupation the Jew Phillip Polack of Benesov was held as a hostage and later perished at a concentration camp. The racial laws, which aimed to remove the Jews from the social and economic life of the country, were not always implemented at Benesov. 54 ritual articles of the community were transferred to the central Jewish museum in Prague.\n\nIn the course of 1942, the majority of the Jews of the protectorate were deported to the ghetto of Terezin (Theresienstadt), and from there to ghettos and concentration camps in Poland and other countries ruled by Germany, and most of them were murdered.\n\nOnly two of the Jews of Benesov returned to it after the war. Jewish life was not revived. The building of the synagogue was demolished by the Czech authorities in 1976. In the 1990s the old Jewish cemetery was turned into a memorial garden. Some tombstones were left in their place and all the others were transferred to the new cemetery, in which are buried also 13 Jewish prisoners from France who found their death in the \u201cdeath march\u201d in 1945.", "He": "\u05d1\u05e0\u05e9\u05d5\u05d1 BENESOV\r\n\r\n(\u05d1\u05d2\u05e8\u05de\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea: BENESCHAU)\r\n\r\n\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8 \u05e0\u05e4\u05d4

called Veseli\n\nThree villages located in the Pisek District, South Bohemia, Czech Republic\n\nThe Jewish cemetery, located in Zbesicky, was restored in 1990 and has about 100 stones dating from the year that the cemetery was established, 1750, through the 20th century. The inscriptions on the gravestones are in Czech, Hebrew, and German. The cemetery is owned by the Praha (Prague) Jewish community. \n\nHISTORY\n\nUntil 1918 the area was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After the collapse of the empire following World War I, and until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Since 1993 it has been part of the Czech Republic. \n\nJews first arrived at Bernartice around the year 1700, though they had already been living in the surrounding villages for many years. The communal and personal lives of the Jews in the neighboring areas were closely intertwined.\n\nJews settled first in Zbesicky (German: Zbeschitz), a village 3.5 miles (about 6km) from Bernartice and 5 miles (8km) southeast of Milevsko. A Jewish Quarter was established before the end of the 17th century. Until the middle of the 19th century there were approximately 20 Jewish families living in the village, making up a majority of the village's residents. A wooden synagogue was eventually built, though it burned down during a fire in 1866, after which a stone building was converted into a synagogue to replace it. A wooden building that served as a Jewish school and community center was one of the first school buildings in the area and, like the village's other institutions, served the Jews in the neighboring villages. A cemetery was founded in 1750, and its chevra kaddisha served the entire area. \n\nVeselicko (German: Weselitschko), located just over 3 miles (just over 5km) from Zbesicky and about 2 miles (approximately 3km) from Bernartice, also had a Jewish Quarter and a fairly large Jewish community by the 18th century. Later prohibitions were put into place forbidding Jews to settle permanently in Veselicko, but the nobleman Nadherny ultimately never observed the law in full because of the economic advantages he enjoyed from their presence in the village. The longest-established Jewish family in the village was the Vodicka family, who worked as traders and owned slaughterhouses. In 1930 the family bought the school building and transformed it into apartments; the income from the rent was used to maintain the regional cemetery in Zbesicky.\n\nThe Jewish community of Bernartice began to thrive after the emancipation of Austrian Jewry in 1848. At that point, the Jews from the surrounding villages, mainly Zbesicky, began settling in Bernartice. The Cohen, Fink, and Mautner families were the longest-established families in Bernartice.   \n\nBetween 1708 and 1848 the Jews of the area were not allowed to work in agriculture, so instead most worked as peddlers. Only in the middle of the 19th century, after they were granted civil rights, did they begin to expand into other trades. They worked as bakers, butchers, tailors, innkeepers, and shopkeepers; many Jews also began farming on a small scale, growing fruit and vegetables for their own use. \n\nThe Jews of Veselicko and Bernartice for many years shared joint communal institutions, including the synagogue and the Jewish school; both were established in Veselicko in 1855 and used by both communities. In 1885 a Jewish school was also established in Bernartice, the same year that the communities decided to merge. Beginning in 1900 the Jewish children of the area attended the Czech government school, which was taught in German, and in the evenings they attended the Jewish school, which was taught in Hebrew. The teacher of the Jewish school also worked as the cantor and the shochet (kosher slaughterer). \n\nDuring the 20th century many Jews throughout the area, including the villages of Bernartice, Zbesicky, and Veselicko, moved to larger towns and cities in pursuit of a wider range of economic opportunities. As a result, by the 1930s only three Jewish families remained in Bernartice (9 people total), and none in Zbesicky or Veselicko. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nAbout a year after the outbreak of World War II, following the Munich Agreement of September 1938, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved and on March 15, 1939 Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany. The Nuremberg Laws gradually excluded the Jews from all areas of public and economic life of the country, until they were finally completely deprived of their rights and property. \n\nTowards the end of 1941 the Germans began to concentrate the Czech Jews in the Theresienstadt (Terezin) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and extermination camps, where most of them were killed.\n\nAfter World War II Jewish life was not renewed in any of the three villages. Remnants of the Jewish Quarter remained in Zbesicky and Veselicko; the synagogue building in Veselicko was destroyed by the Czech authorities in 1986.

Bohemia, Czech Republic\n\nBeroun is located 19 miles (30km) southwest of Prague. Until 1918 the area was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After the collapse of the empire following World War I, and until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Since 1993 it has been part of the Czech Republic. \n\nThe Jewish cemetery of Beroun is owned by the Jewish community of Prague, which rents out parts of the cemetery for gardening in order to pay the caretaker. The cemetery contains hundreds of graves, from 1885 when the cemetery was established through the 20th century. Gravestones are written in Hebrew, German, and/or Czech, and among the tombstones are several family memorials. The house where bodies were taken for preparation for burial also remains standing within the cemetery. A plaque by the main entrance commemorates the founders of the local chevra kaddisha, and lists rules related to proper behavior within the cemetery. The cemetery has been maintained throughout the 21st century. \n\nHISTORY\n\nBeroun was not only the location of its own Jewish community, it was also the center for a number of Jewish villages and other small settlements in the surrounding area, where Jews made up less than 3% of the total population. Though Beroun saw its first Jewish resident in 1678, Mates Fiser who had been invited to the village to practice tanning, a Jewish community was not established until 1849, when the residence restrictions for Jews were lifted. Beroun had a synagogue, a Jewish school, and a cemetery which was established in 1885/1886. In 1910 there were 402 Jews living in Beroun, though that number had dropped to 290 by 1921. Rudolf Roubicek was the president of the community in 1921 and Rivrid Kraus was the rabbi, serving both Beroun and the surrounding communities. During the 1930s Dr. Moritz Mueller served as the community's rabbi and also taught Jewish studies. \n\nFollowing is information about some of the affiliated communities in the area:  \n\nHorovice, which is located approximately 12 miles (19km) southwest of Beroun, saw its first Jews arrive during the 15th century, though they were no longer allowed to live within the town's walls during the 17th and 19th centuries. A Jewish community was reorganized in Horovice in 1875 and a synagogue was built in 1903. A traveling rabbi from Strakonice, Rabbi J. Flaschner, taught Jewish children. The Jews of Horovice were also served by the cemetery in Praskolesy. In 1910 there were 279 Jews living in Horovice. By 1921 that number had dropped to 215, and by 1930 there were only 50 Jews left in the town. Joseph Abeles was among the leaders of the community. \n\nHostomice, a small town 6 miles (10km) east of Horovice. This community had a prayer house in a private home, and founded a cemetery during the first half of the 19th century. During the second half of the 19th century, against a backdrop of struggles between national Czechs and Germans, riots broke out against the Jews, whom the Czechs regarded as Germans. Among the heads of this community was Moritz Novak. \n\nLiten (German: Litten), which is located 5 miles (8km) southeast of Beroun, granted the Jews living there full residence rights particularly early, allowing them to live among their Christian neighbors and not in a separate area. In 1680 Count Jaroslav Kunata granted the community permission to establish a cemetery, which also served other small Jewish communities in the area; later, a wooden tombstone dated from 1843 was transferred to the Jewish National museum in Prague. Count Kunata also allowed the community to build a synagogue and a school. In 1715 there were four Jewish families (22 people) living in Liteny. By 1793 that number had grown to 23 families (102 people), and in 1849 the number of Jews living in the town was 190. Following the emancipation of the Jews of Bohemia in 1848 many Jews moved to bigger towns and cities, depleting the communities in more rural areas. By 1890 the number of Jews living in Liten had dropped to 52; by 1930 there were only 13 Jews remaining. \n\nBestine had a prayer house and Vseradice had an older synagogue which, by the 20th century, had fallen into disuse. \n\nMorina is located approximately 6 miles (10km) east of Beroun. A small Jewish community was established in the village in 1760, but it was officially organized during the second half of the 19th century, though a cemetery had been established earlier. The western part of the town included a small Jewish Quarter with 8 houses, including a synagogue that would exist until 1907. During the first half of the 19th century there were 16 families living in Morina. The Jewish population steadily declined throughout the years, and in 1908 the community of Morina was united with the community of Beroun. Dr. Jakob Eduard Pollak, the personal physician of the Persian Shah and who helped introduce modern medicine to Iran, was originally from Morina. \n\nTetin, one of the most ancient Jewish communities in Bohemia, is located approximately 3 miles (5km) northwest of Liten and 4 miles (6.5km) from Beroun. Tetin's community was independent, and contained a synagogue, a cemetery, a mikvah, a community house, and a Jewish school. The Jews left the village in 1872 and the Torah scrolls and other ritual objects, along with the school and office equipment, were moved to Beroun. The community house and synagogue were bought by the nobleman Jan Vojacek, who made sure that the synagogue was used only for religious purposes and that the community building served to aid the public. \n\nMost of the Jews living in Beroun and its associated communities were traders and artisans and, beginning in the 19th century, a number also worked as professionals. All of the communities associated with Beroun had their own active chevra kaddisha. \n\nIn 1930 there were approximately 113 Jews living in Beroun. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of September 29, 1938, about a year before the outbreak of World War II, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved. The areas of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany on March 15, 1939, after which the Jews living in the area were gradually deprived of their rights and properties. \n\nBeginning in November 1941 the Germans concentrated the Jews remaining in the Czech territory in the Terezin (German: Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps, mainly in Poland, where most were killed. \n\nBefore their expulsions, 295 documents, 6 books, and 98 ritual objects were transferred to the central Jewish museum in Prague. Ninety-two additional ritual objects were transferred from Hostomice. \n\nAfter the war, Jewish life was not revived in Beroun or the surrounding areas. The synagogue and Jewish school in Beroun were turned into an art and music school. The Horovice Synagogue was used by the Evangelical Church of Czech Brethren. They synagogue in Letiny was repurposed as a fire station. The synagogue in Tetin was destroyed in 1974.

(10km) southwest of the town of Teplice-Sanov. Until 1918 the area was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After the collapse of the empire following World War I, and until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Since 1993 it has been part of the Czech Republic. \n\nThere are records mentioning Jewish people in Bilina as far back as 1417, and there is a record from 1543 of two Jews asking, ultimately in vain, for permission to settle in the town. Further evidence regarding Jewish life in Bilina dates to the 18th century. In 1787 an employee of the local government was punished for assaulting the 70 year old rabbi, and a record from 1788 refers to Jacob Oppenheimer, a merchant of spirits and cattle. In 1793 there were 5 Jews living in Bilina, and 1,642 Christians. \n\nBefore 1813, a small Jewish community was formed in Kremyz (German: Kremusch), 2.5 miles (4km) from Teplice-Sanov and 5 miles (8km) from Belina. Graf Ledebur, who owned the land, allowed the Jews to settle on his estate, as well as to build two prayer houses. Both the community of Bilina, as well as the community of Kremyz ultimately became affiliated with the community of Teplice-Sanov. \n\nUntil the end of the 19th century, the cemetery of Teplice-Sanov served the entire subdistrict of Bilina. The rabbi of Teplice would visit the small communities in the region approximately three times a year. The two communities were also served by the same cantor. In 1858 there were 81 Jews living in Bilina, Kremyz, and the surrounding area. In 1888 the community of Kremyz dissolved after most of the Jews who had lived there moved to Teplice-Sanov. The property of the prayer house was transferred to Bilina. \n\nIn 1891 a cemetery was established in Bilina, and in 1895 a house was acquired for a synagogue. During that time Jacob Glaser was the cantor and the shohet (ritual slaughterer). A chevra kaddisha was established in 1895, and a women's society in 1901. \n\nThere were 200 members of the community in 1921. The rabbis who served the community were Rabbi Brock (1895-1906), Rabbi Ignatz Loewy (1907-1915), Rabbi Arpad Hirschberger (1912), and Rabbi Dr. Sonnenschein (1912-1914). During World War I Bilna did not have a rabbi. After the war, Rabbi Samuel Ungerman was the rabbi between 1922-1925 and was succeeded by Rabbi Samuel Friedl (1926-1929). The community's last rabbi was Rabbi Dr. Teller, who served during the 1930s. \n\nMost of the Jews of Bilina worked as tradesmen, but some worked as lawyers or in other professional fields. Additionally, some Jews served on the local council.\n\nAfter Jews were granted full civil and religious rights in 1848, they began integrating into the public and social life of the country. During World War I many Jewish men from the community joined the Austro-Hungarian Army and won medals of distinction during their service. Some also fell in battle, including Hugo Abeles. \n\nZionism became popular in Bilina and other areas around the time that Jews were recognized as a national minority in the Republic of Czechoslovakia. The Jews from Bilina acquired voting and membership rights for the 20th Zionist Congress in 1937. \n\nIn 1930 there were 74 Jews living in Bilina. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of September 29, 1938, about a year before the outbreak of World War II, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved. The areas of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany on March 15, 1939, after which the Jews living in the area were gradually deprived of their rights and properties. \n\nBeginning in November 1941 the Germans concentrated the Jews remaining in the Czech territory in the Terezin (German: Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps, mainly in Poland, where most were killed. \n\nJewish life was not revived after World War II. The synagogue building was converted into a private home. The Jewish cemetery, which had been partially destroyed by the war, was also disturbed after the war by vandals as well as thieves, who were looking for gold that they believed was buried in the cemetery. Their searches left open graves and exposed bones. There is a mass grave for Soviet prisoners of war, who were buried in the cemetery between 1942 and 1945.

its beautiful rose gardens. The town contains an 11th-century castle, and is surrounded by woods. Until 1918 the area was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After the collapse of the empire following World War I, and until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Since 1993 it has been part of the Czech Republic. \n\nIn spite of the fact that the Jewish community of Blatna was never particularly large, it nonetheless had four Torah scrolls. Among the objects that were transferred by the Nazis to the Jewish Museum in Prague were the scrolls from Blatna; they became four among the 1,564 Torah scrolls that were stored in Prague throughout the war and during the postwar period. In 1964 all of the Torahs were purchased by Ralph C. Yablon and transferred to the Westminster Synagogue. Temple Israel of Boston received one of the Blatna Torah scrolls in 1975, where it has remained. \n\nHISTORY\n\nA counselor of Baron Vaclav of Rozdrazova, referenced in a 1622 letter, is the first Jewish person to have been mentioned in connection with Blatna. A year later his house was destroyed by a fire, prompting him to move. In 1683 Solomon Samuel Voticky arrived in Blatna and leased a distillery from the estate owner, as well as a place where he could extract draslarna (a kind of potash used in making soap). He lived near the estate, in a place called Zidovna. The first Jewish person to settle in Blatna itself was granted permission in 1696 by the local ruler, Baron Kolovrat, to open a store and to keep a cow. \n\nAt the end of the 18th century there were a number of people living in Blatna who had converted to Christianity, because only Christians were allowed to live in the town. Jews were allowed to settle in the town only after the local government appealed to state authorities for permission to allow Jews to settle there.\n\nThere were 107 Jews living in Blatna in 1890, though the population began to decline shortly thereafter; just before World War I the number of Jews living in Blatna had decreased to 48. The Jews of Blatna built a community house and a prayer house. The closest cemetery was in the town of Mirotice. The Jews worked mostly as traders, particularly in cattle and meat.\n\nIsidor Beck and Solomon Neuman served as rabbis and religious teachers beginning in 1895. The community's leaders were Jacob Kraus, Leopold Fantl, Simon Basch, and Bedrich Bloch. \n\nJust before the outbreak of World War II there were only several dozen Jews remaining in Blatna. Particularly after Jews were granted full civil and religious rights in 1848, many began leaving for larger towns and cities in pursuit of the wide range of opportunities these places offered.  \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of September 29, 1938, about a year before the outbreak of World War II, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved. The areas of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany on March 15, 1939, after which the Jews living in the area were gradually deprived of their rights and properties. \n\nBeginning in November 1941 the Germans concentrated the Jews remaining in the Czech territory in the Terezin (German: Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps, mainly in Poland, where most were killed. Before their deportation, 48 ritual articles and four books about the community were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague.\n\nAfter the war, the prayer house was turned into a police station.

"Blovice\n\nGerman: Blowitz\n\nA town in the Pilsen region, southwest Bohemia, Czech Republic\n\nBlovice lies on the Uslava River and on a railroad, about 13 miles (21km) southeast of Plzen. Until 1918 the area was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After the collapse of the empire following World War I, and until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Since 1993 it has been part of the Czech Republic. \n\nAt the beginning of the 16th century Jews who had been expelled from the larger towns, particularly Plzen, found refuge in Blovice. A Jewish cemetery was established in 1683 and the prayer house was located in the home of the Kraus family until it was destroyed in 1903. That year a synagogue was built with the help of the rabbi of Benesov, the mayor of Blovice, and the town's Catholic priests. \n\nEleven Jewish families were expelled from the town in 1747, following new restrictive laws put into place by local rulers seeking to limit the number of Jews in the town. Jews were not allowed to purchase additional houses, to trade in hay and in timber, or to raise cattle. Nonetheless, in 1788 Jews were living in 13 of the 143 houses in the town, and in 1838 seventeen of the 169 houses in the town were occupied by Jews. \n\nDuring the middle of the 19th century, Leopold Fischl was the leader of the community. He was succeeded by Salomon Goldscheider and Bedrich Weisskopf. Among the community's rabbis was Rabbi Shlomo Schwartzkopf, who was also a scientist and who served the community for 45 years, until 1871. The last rabbi was Rabbi Jonasch Traub, who served until 1924. \n\nThe journalist Henry George Stefan Opper de Blowitz (1825-1903) and Adolf Kraus (1850-1928), the chairman of B'nai B'rith in the United States, were notable figures from Blovice. \n\nThe relations between the Jews of Blovice and their Christian neighbors were generally good, though there were difficult periods. During the Hilsner Affair, a blood libel that took place in eastern Bohemia between 1899 and 1900, the mayor of Blovice made a number of anti-Semitic remarks and dismissed two Jews from the town council. \n\nIn 1880 there were 158 people living in the community, though they soon began emigrating, either to the United States or to bigger towns and cities. This followed a general pattern after Jews were granted full civil and religious rights in 1848. By the 1930s there were only 25 Jews remaining in Blovice. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of September 29, 1938, about a year before the outbreak of World War II, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved. The areas of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany on March 15, 1939, after which the Jews living in the area were gradually deprived of their rights and properties. \n\nBeginning in November 1941 the Germans concentrated the Jews remaining in the Czech territory in the Terezin (German: Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps, mainly in Poland, where most were killed. \n\nAfter the war, the synagogue was converted into an office building. The Plzen Jewish community owns the cemetery, which is not in good condition.

There are in this town a preserved castle, the remnants of an ancient bridge, and churches built in gothic and renaissance styles. Until 1918 the area belonged to the Austro-Hungarian empire and since 1918 till 1993 to the Czechoslovak republic.\n\nThe first Jews came to Brandys apparently in the 16th century and were permitted to settle in a few houses by the watermill at the foot of the palace. There they established some sort of a school and a prayer place. The Jews of the town were obliged to wear \u201cJewish clothes\u201d in order to distinguish them from the other residents. In 1559 king Ferdinand I ordered to expel all Jews from Bohemia. The Jews of Brandys, hoping to come back soon, deposited their property and the synagogue in the hands of the leaders of the town. The emperor Maximilian, the heir of Ferdinand, actually permitted their return in the year 1568. The very same year a cemetery was consecrated half a kilometer north-west of the central square. In the course of the years a funeral building was constructed and in it a residence for the guard of the cemetery. The Jews that came to this town after the expulsion occupied houses also outside the palace area, in a street later known as \u201cthe Jew\u2019s street\u201d. The Jewish community was headed by two \u201celders of the community\u201d.\n\nIn 1648, at the end of the 30 years war (1618-1648), many Jews abandoned Brandys, leaving their property behind. Other Jews who wished to settle in Brandys met difficulties, since the residents complained that the number of Jews settling in Brandys grew enormously. In 1705 the authorities permitted 7 Jewish families and 4 single Jews to live at this town. Moreover, they were forbidden to allow visiting Jews from other places to stay at their homes. In 1723 22 Jewish families resided in Brandys. The law passed by the emperor Karl VI (1726) limited the number of Jewish families in the towns of the empire, and in 1746, when the Jews were expelled from Prague, more Jews came to Brandys. Some of them were obliged to convert to Christianity, and then they were permitted to live outside the ghetto.\n\nIn the small Jewish community of Kostelec Nad Labem, 7 kilometers north-west of Brandys, 5 Jewish families and several Jewish bachelors lived. The bachelors were permitted to establish families only if they did not exceed the number of families allowed in this little town. The Jews of Kostelec had a cemetery and a school and in 1886 they acquired a hayloft, which they turned into a synagogue. Until the end of the 18th century the Jews in this area spoke Czech and Hebrew. Following the \u201ctolerance edict\u201d (1782) by emperor Joseph II, whose object was to bring the minorities closer to the German culture, some of the limitations were lifted; they opened in Brandys a Jewish elementary school, where they taught in the German language. A hevra-kaddisha was founded at Brandys in 1795. In 1797 the Jewish houses were numbered by Latin numbers, in order to differentiate them from the Christian homes which bore regular numbers. In 1786 some Jews were already permitted to rent appartments in gentile houses.\n \nThe synagogue was erected in the years 1828 - 1829, north-west of the ancient center of the town, where the ancient prayer place of the 16th century was. Close to the synagogue a new community center was erected, where the community officials lived and a four classes school was established. In 1893 380 Jews were registered in the Brandys community. Famous rabbis were active in the Brandys community from the start. At the beginning of the 20th century rabbi M. Mandl served as rabbi.\n\nThe first Jews in Brandys and Kostelec made a living as peddlers, money lenders and lessees of estates and enterprises. There were among them a few merchants, who dealt mainly in cattle, meat, yarns, fabrics and spices. The merchants had their stores in their homes. Already in the 16th century the craftsmen and butchers among the gentiles objected to the settlement of Jews for fear of competition, and only in the 18th century were some Jewish merchants permitted to have sale stalls at the market. The local authorities were interested in the Jews because of the high taxes which they paid and because of their contribution to the town\u2019s economy. In the course of the 2nd half of the 19th century there were among the Jews also professionals.\n\nIn 1848 the Jews of the Austrian empire received full citizen rights and became an integral part of the society. Following the lifting of limitations on Jews, many Jews left Brandys for the larger towns and the community gradually declined. Between the two world wars, most of the Jews spoke Czech. In 1920 the Jews in Czechoslovakia were recognized as a national- cultural minority. In 1921 272 Jews (6% of the population) were registered in the community, headed by Dr. Richard Ullmann. 13 of them declared they belonged to the Jewish nation, the rest declared themselves as Czechs.\n\nBrandys is the origin of the Jewish family name Brandeis.\n\nIn 1930 there were 60 Jews living in Brandys.\n\nThe Holocaust Period\nThe Munich agreement of September 1938 caused the dismemberment of the Czechoslovak republic about a year before the outbreak of World War II. On March 15 1939 the Germans entered the Czech territory (Bohemia and Moravia) and declared it a protectorate of the Third Reich. The Jews were gradually deprived of their rights and properties and finally in 1941 the Jews of the protectorate were sent to the ghetto of Terezin (Theresienstadt) from where they were deported to death camps, mainly in Poland. Most of them were murdered by the Germans. Before their expulsion 75 ritual articles and 11 books of the community were sent to the central Jewish museum in Prague.\n\nAfter the war there was no Jewish community life in Brandys. The synagogue was turned into a warehouse. In the cemetery, as in Prague, the tombstones are very close to one another. Some very old renaissance and baroque tombstones are preserved.", "He": "\u05d1\u05e8\u05d0\u05e0\u05d3\u05d9\u05e1 \u05e0\u05d0\u05d3 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d1\u05dd BRANDYS NAD

Republic\n\nThe building that once housed the synagogue underwent a series of renovations during the late 1990s and at the turn of the 20th century. The building houses the Breclav Museum and includes an exhibit about, and artifacts from, the Jewish community that once existed in the town. A memorial plaque is located in the entrance hall, commemorating the Jewish community. \n\nThe Jewish cemetery, which was founded during the 17th century, contains approximately 400 tombstones dating from the 18th until the 20th century. The cemetery incurred heavy damages during the 1980s, but was restored between 1991 and 1993. \n\nOf the 72 houses that stood in the Jewish quarter, 24 remain. Among them is the former school, which was originally built in 1884 and now houses the Liechtenstein Museum. \n\nHISTORY\n\nThe first reference to Jews in Breclav dates to 1411. By the middle of the 16th century there was a large Jewish community in the town, as well as a synagogue. This community, however, was the victim of violence that erupted in 1574, 1605, and 1622 and was ultimately destroyed when the city was captured by the Swedes in 1643. \n\nJews expelled from the Austrian town of Feldberg settled in Breclav in 1651 and began to build a Jewish community. They observed the 11th day of the Hebrew month of Tevet as a holiday to commemorate their escape in 1697 when the synagogue roof collapsed while the congregation was waiting to enter. \n\nMordecai Banet served as the rabbi of the community from 1787 until 1789 and the historian Heinrich Graetz taught at the Jewish school from 1850 until 1852. The opera singer Julius Lieban (1857-1940) was born in Breclav. \n\nThe Breslav synagogue was built in 1868; 20 years later it was renovated and rebuilt in the Romaniesque Revival style with some Moorish elements in the interior. \n\nIn 1702 there were 30 Jewish families living in 12 houses in Breclav and 66 families in 1726. There were 589 Jews living in the town in 1930 (4.3% of the total population), the majority (432) of whom declared their nationality as Jewish.\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of September 29, 1938, about a year before the outbreak of World War II, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved. The areas of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany on March 15, 1939, after which the Jews living in the area were gradually deprived of their rights and properties. \n\nBeginning in November 1941 the Germans concentrated the Jews remaining in the Czech territory in the Terezin (German: Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps, mainly in Poland, where most were killed. Many of the objects remaining in the synagogue were sent to the Jewish Central Museum in Prague. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nFor 50 years, during and after World War II, the building that once housed the synagogue was used for storage. During the mid-1990s the synagogue building was acquired by the Breclav municipality and underwent a major reconstruction between 1997 and 2000.

"Breznice\n\n(German: Bresnitz)\n\nA town in the district of Pribram, south-west Bohemia, Czech Republic.\n\nBreznice is situated in an area where mainly rye is grown, on a railroad junction. In the town are preserved 2 churches of the 17th century and a castle of the time of the Renaissance, in which an art collection is kept. Till 1918 the area belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and since then, until 1993, to the Republic of Czechoslovakia.\n\nJews started to settle in Breznice apparently in the 1560s.  A Jewish town is first mentioned in 1570, outside the town walls, in a section allocated to the Jews by Graf Ferdinand von Loksan. The place was called Loksan. In 1649 there lived in Loksan 17 Jewish families. The \"Jewish town\" consisted of 22 houses in 2 alleys and 2 squares. In the house of the rabbi was also a mikveh, in the yard of the house was a small hut, in which the slaughtering of poultry took place. For some time there was in one of the houses a kitchen that served food to passing visitors and merchants, who came to the markets held in Breznice. A synagogue was built in one of the squares in 1725, when the number of Jewish families reached 25. Among the ritual articles that remained is a curtain of the holy ark of the year 1793, the donation of Joachim Popper. On the second floor of the synagogue was a heder. In 1745 anti-Jewish disturbances broke out in Breznice, in the course of which the southern part of the cemetery was destroyed and only the northern part remained, close to the Vlacavka River and in it the funeral house. \n\nIn 1797 16 Jewish children attended a general school in the German language. The course of time the community organized its own school, also in the German language. This school was closed down in 1901, when the Jews started to use the Czech language. In 1824 145 Jewish people lived in Loksan. The synagogue was destroyed by fire in 1821 and with the help of Graf Colobret Krakowski it was rebuilt; exactly as before, only the bimah was moved from the centre closer to the Holy Ark. The synagogue was last renovated in 1874. Following the emancipation of the Jews in Bohemia (1848), the Jews began leaving the crowded Jewish quarter and the community gradually declined in numbers. In 1900 118 Jews lived in the community; in 1910 only 68; and in 1921 just 41.\n\nFrom 1720 Breznice served as the seat of the area rabbi; the first of them was Rabbi Isack Spitz. Mendel Pollak, the area rabbi in the years 1815- 1866, opened in 1830 a Jewish Talmud Torah, but in 1941 it was closed down because of financial difficulties. A collection of 695 letters which portray the life of the Jews in southern Bohemia at that time remained after his term of office. The last area rabbi to reside in Breznice was rabbi Prazak and since 1881 the area rabbi was a resident of Pribram. The local rabbis in Breznice were: rabbi Adolf Traub, Rabbi Ignatz Nettl, Rabbi Joseph Miller, Rabbi Prof. Dr. Karl Cohen (who delivered his sermons in the Czech language) and the last rabbi, Adolf Neu, elected in 1915. The religious slaughterer was also the beadle of the synagogue.\n\nMost of the Jews of Breznice were traders, who did business also in the large fairs of Leipzig. There were among them the lessees of the liquor distilleries and the renters of the potash industry, craftsmen, and since the 19th century also professional people. Joachim Popper, a merchant in fish-bones, in potash and in pearls, and the only licensee of the business in tobacco, brought to the town\u2019s treasury large amounts of money, paid his employees generously and in the years of the hunger 1770-1772 helped needy Jews and non-Jews alike. In 1780 he was awarded a title of nobility (among the first of the Jews of Bohemia). He moved to Prague and dealt in lending money, among others to the royal house. The award of nobility to a Jew caused anti-Jewish riots in all bohemia and in Vienna.\n", "He": "\u05d1\u05d6'\u05d6\u05e0\u05d9\u05e6\u05d4

townof Nachod, and about 19 miles (30km) northeast of the town of Velka-Bukovina (German: Grossbock). Until 1918 the area was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After the collapse of the empire following World War I, and until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Since 1993 it has been part of the Czech Republic. \n\nBroumov never had a particularly large Jewish community. Until 1848, when Jews throughout the Austrian Empire were emancipated, only a few \"protected Jews,\" those employed by the local nobles, were permitted to settle in the town; a census indicates that only 7 Jews were living in Broumov in 1857. By 1880 there were 52 Jews living in the town itself; that number increased to 70 in 1900. At its peak, in 1910, there were 100 Jews living in Broumov. \n\nA prayer house was established at the beginning of the 20th century.  The Jewish community of Broumov was mostly affiliated with the Jewish community of Velka Burkovina. \n\nThe Jews of Broumov established a liquor distillery, a wool factory, a cotton mill, a flax-spinning mill, and a dying and printing factory. Jewish merchants traded mostly in textiles, skins, haberdashery, curtains, sewing machines, and sports goods. There were also a number of lawyers and two physicians. \n\nBetween the two World Wars the Jews of Broumov, following a more general trend that was taking place during that time, began emigrating and the population began to decline dramatically. In 1921 only 68 Jews remained in the town, 9 of whom declared their nationality as Jewish. By 1930 there were 47 Jews living in the town. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nThe Munich Agreement of September 1938, about a year before the outbreak of World War II, forced the Republic of Czechoslovakia to cede the Sudeten region to Nazi Germany. At this point, Jews in the area could still leave, and many left for Palestine, the United Kingdom, Canada, and South Africa. Some Jews also moved to other areas in the interior of the country. The areas of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany on March 15, 1939, after which the Jews living in the area were gradually deprived of their rights and properties. \n\nBeginning in November 1941 the Germans concentrated the Jews remaining in the Czech territory in the Terezin (German: Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps, mainly in Poland, where most were killed. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nIn 1946 a Jewish transit camp was established in Broumov for Jewish refugees who had escaped Poland after the riots that broke out against them. The camp was run by Czech authorities, but the food was supplied by Czech Jews, Zionists (particularly the Irgun HaBeriha, which sought to help Jews illegally immigrate to Mandate Palestine), the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). Approximately 32,000 Jews passed through the transit camps at Broumov and Nachod. \n\n\n\n ", "He": "\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05d5\u05d1

miles (12km) southeast of the district town of Jihlava and nearly 78 miles (124km) from Prague. Until 1918 the area was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After the collapse of the empire following World War I, and until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Since 1993 it has been part of the Czech Republic.\n\nIn 2007 a memorial plaque was placed on a wall in the shopping mall that was constructed where the synagogue and other buildings formerly owned by the Jewish community once stood. \n\nThe newer of Brtnice's two Jewish cemeteries is owned by the Brno Jewish community who funds its upkeep. Many of the gravestones, written in Czech, German, and/or Hebrew, have remained standing. \n\nHISTORY\n\nJews probably began to settle in Brtnice around the 14th century though the community began to form in earnest during the first half of the 15th century after the Jews were expelled from Jihlava. A Jewish Quarter was established during the first half of the 17th century. During the middle of the 19th century there were 420 Jews living in the town and 50 houses,  belonged to the Jewish residents. \n\nThe synagogue was located in the Jewish Quarter north of the town square. The building was expanded in 1888 and a women's gallery was added to its west side. There was also a community house. The old cemetery, less than a mile (1km) northeast of the town square, was established before 1600. A second cemetery was opened south of the old one during the 19th century.\n\nAfter the emancipation of the Jews in the Austrian Empire in 1848 and the gradual abolition of residence restrictions, Jews throughout the area began moving to larger towns and cities. One result was that smaller towns, such as Brtnice, saw their populations decline. In 1921 there were 52 Jews living in Brtnice, 24 of whom paid taxes, and by 1930 there were only 33 Jews living in Brtnice.\n\nSimon Bretschneider was the head of the community during the 1920s, and the rabbi was Abraham Kurzweil. The chevra kaddisha and the women's society were still active. The Jews of Brtnice spoke Czech and German. Zionism became popular between the two World Wars and members of the community acquired voting rights for the elections to the 15th Zionist Congress in 1927. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of September 29, 1938, about a year before the outbreak of World War II, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved. The areas of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany on March 15, 1939, after which the Jews living in the area were gradually deprived of their rights and properties. \n\nBeginning in November 1941 the Germans concentrated the Jews remaining in the Czech territory in the Terezin (German: Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps, mainly in Poland, where most were killed. Only two Jews from Brtnice survived the war, neither of whom returned to the town. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nJewish life was not revived in Brtnice after the war. The synagogue building fell into disuse and in 1988 it was demolished along with the school, town hall, and a number of other buildings to make way for a shopping mall. The newer of the two cemeteries was repaired during the 1980s. \n\n\n ", "He": "\u05d1\u05e8\u05d8\u05e0\u05d9\u05e6\u05d4 BRTNICE\r\n\r\n\u05d1\u05d2\u05e8\u05de\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea

After the collapse of the empire following World War I, and until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Since 1993 it has been part of the Czech Republic. \n\nThere is not a lot of information about the origin and development of the Jewish community in Bruntal. During the second half of the 19th century, the earliest known period when a Jewish community existed in the town, there were 73 Jews living in Bruntal. The cemetery, which also seems to have been established at the end of the 19th century, was destroyed by the Nazis during World War II (though some gravestones remained standing, albeit in poor condition) and the prayer house was converted into an apartment. \n\nZionism became popular in the town between the two World Wars, and a number of residents acquired voting rights during the 15th Zionist Congress in 1927. \n\nA census conducted in 1910 reveals that the town's total population was 8,066, of whom 97 (1.2%) were Jewish. Jews were not allowed to declare Yiddish as their mother tongue; most declared German. In a census conducted in 1930 there were 106 Jews recorded as living in the jurisdictional area, 81 of whom lived in the town itself. Of those, 18 declared their nationality as Jewish. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of September 29, 1938, about a year before the outbreak of World War II, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved and the Sudeten Region was ceded to Nazi Germany. At that point, most of the Jews escaped from the Sudeten region to the Czech interior. However, the areas of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany on March 15, 1939, after which the Jews living in the area were gradually deprived of their rights and properties. \n\nBeginning in November 1941 the Germans concentrated the Jews remaining in the Czech territory in the Terezin (German: Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps, mainly in Poland, where most were killed. \n", "He": "\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05e0\u05d8\u05d0\u05dc

Rousinov.  Until 1918 the area was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After the collapse of the empire following World War I, and until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Since 1993 it has been part of the Czech Republic. \n\nThe cemetery of Bucovice is still standing and in good condition. The tombstones date from the mid-18th through the twentieth century and the inscriptions are written in Hebrew, German, and Czech. The cemetery is owned by the Brno Jewish community, which supports the cemetery's upkeep.  \n\nHISTORY\n\nThe Jewish community of Bucovice is one of the oldest in Moravia. It was established by Jews who were expelled from the city of Brno in 1454, though there is speculation that there were Jews living in the town even earlier. A synagogue was built in 1690 and later renovated in 1853. Though it is unclear exactly when the cemetery was established, there are tombstones dating to the 18th century. Jews were permitted to purchase houses outside of the Jewish quarter in 1709. \n\nDuring the 18th century the community's importance grew, evidenced by the fact that it hosted conventions of the Jewish leaders of Moravia in 1709, 1724, and 1748. The Jewish community of Bucovice was one of the 52 \"politische gemeine\" (political communities) with an independent municipal authority recognized by the authorities in Moravia in 1798; in 1849 the status of the community changed to a kultusgemeinde (a religious-cultural community). A Jewish school opened during the late 18th century and a chevra kaddisha was established in 1878. The community was also home to a women's society, as well as a Bikkur Kholim. \n\nBy 1673 there were 11 homes owned by 9 Jewish families in Bucovice and in 1725 there were 24 houses in the Jewish Quarter and 2 more homes in the Christian area of the town occupied by Jews. There were 508 Jews living in Bucovice in 1798 and in 1848 there were 566. \n\nAmong the community's rabbis were Rabbi Avigdor, Rabbi Meir of Pinczow, Rabbi Jacob, Rabbi Shlomo Tuerkels, Rabbi Yair Brenner, Rabbi Nathan Zorn, Rabbi Hirsch Duschak, Rabbi Bernard Loewenstein (who wrote religious-educational poetry including \"Gruss an Palestina\"), Rabbi Dr. Herman Lipschitz, and Rabbi Dr. Avraham Loewy, who served the community between 1874 and 1889. Beginning in 1894 the community was affiliated with the Rousinov rabbinate. \n\nDuring the middle of the 18th century the Jews worked as shopkeepers, peddlers, butchers, tailors, tanners, distillers, and bathhouse attendants. After the Jews of Moravia were emancipated in 1848 more began working as professionals. Well-known figures from Bucovice included the pianist and composer Joseph Fischhof, who was born in Bucovice in 1804 and died in Vienna in 1857. \n\nThe Republic of Czechoslovakia, which was founded in 1918, recognized the Jews as a national minority with civil and religious rights. The decline in Bucovice's Jewish population, which had begun after the emancipation of the Jews of Moravia in 1848, continued after the establishment of the Republic as Jews began seeking opportunities in larger towns and cities. There were 180 Jews living in Bucovice in 1900, but by 1921 that number had decreased to 135. In 1930 there were only 64 Jews (2% of the total population) living in the town, only 13 of whom declared their nationality as Jewish. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of September 29, 1938, about a year before the outbreak of World War II, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved. The areas of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany on March 15, 1939, after which the Jews living in the area were gradually deprived of their rights and properties. \n\nBeginning in November 1941 the Germans concentrated the Jews remaining in the Czech territory in the Terezin (German: Theresienstadt) Ghetto; the Jews of Bucovice were sent to the ghetto between March and April 1942. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps, mainly in Poland, where most were killed.

with tombstones dating from the 17th century until the 20th century, has been preserved; its upkeep is sponsored by the Jewish community of Brno. Also preserved are the pre-burial house, an ohel, a wall, and vaults. \n\nHISTORY\n\nThe community of Bzenec was one of the oldest in Moravia; a Bzenec medieval chronicler refers to the town as \"nidus Judaeorum\" (\"Nest of Jews\"). Relatively unusually for the time, during the 15th century the Jews were allowed to own vineyards.  During that period viticulture was a major source of income in the area, and the Jewish community contributed significantly to its development. The town, including the Jewish Quarter, was destroyed in 1458 during the war between George Podiebrad of Bohemia and Matthias of Hungary. \n\nIn 1604 there were 400 Jewish residents, living in 49 buildings, as well as a Jewish hospital. However, the Jewish Quarter was again destroyed in 1605, this time by the Transylvanian prince Stephen Bocskai.  Nearly 150 years later, during the first Silesian war of 1742, the Jewish community was affected by new discriminatory laws. In addition to having to pay high taxes, they were also subject to Empress Maria Theresa's 1553 Family Ordinance (Familien-Verordnung), which imposed residence restrictions on Jews in the area; only 137 Jews were permitted to live in Bzenec. There was further trouble in 1777 when nearly the entire Jewish Quarter, including 93 Jewish-owned houses, burned down. \n\nBeginning in 1852, after the 1848 emancipation of the Jews in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the community was recognized as an autonomous political community (politische gemeinde). A new synagogue was built in 1863; the synagogue that was demolished in 1859 had probably stood for 500 years. There was also a matzah factory, as well as a sugar refinery owned by Rudolph Auspitz. \n\nRabbis of the town included Nehemiah Bruell (1866-1870) and Moses Rosenmann (1894-1897). Other notable figures who were born in Bzenec, or who lived there at some point in their lives, were the artist Max Kurzweil, the linguist Norbert Jokl, the eye doctor (and father of Austrian physician Hans Konigstein) Leopold Konigstein, the merchant and inventor (and father of the artist Wolfgang Paalen) Gustav Robert Paalen, the journalist Gerda Rodel (born Gerda Neuwirth), the 16th-century author Moses ben Isaac, the Jewish educator Moses ben Aaron Morawczyk, and Rabbi Samuel Muhsam. \n\nIn 1753 there were 137 families living in the community. Just over one hundred years later the Jewish population peaked at 965. In 1900 there were 416 people in the community, and 138 (3.4% of the total population) in 1930. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nIn January of 1943 the Jews of Bzenec were deported to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto via Kyjov. From the ghetto they were sent to concentration and death camps. Meanwhile, the synagogue's ritual objects were sent to the Jewish Central Museum in Prague. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nA small congregation, administered by the Kyjov community, was reestablished after World War II. In 1956 a monument was dedicated in the cemetery in memory of the Nazi victims of World War II.

The Lipy Water Factory also includes a memorial to the Jews who once lived in the city. Though there is a Jewish cemetery, it contains unmarked mass graves from 1945 and memorials to Holocaust victims; none of the original tombstones remain. In 2007 a memorial commemorating the Jewish victims of a 1945 death march was vandalized. The memorial's menorah was stolen, along with Stars of David and a plaque with the victim's names. \n\nHISTORY\n\nEvidence of a Jewish presence in the city dates back to 1562, and records from 1570 indicate that Ceska Lipa was home to 14 Jewish taxpayers. In 1628 there were 11 houses inhabited by Jews. From 1646 until the end of the 17th century jurisdiction over the Jews of the city was the subject of a longstanding legal battle between the local lordship (Herrschaft) and the municipality. One of the issues was the ownership of the Jewish cemetery, where the Herrschaft had built a wall at its expense in 1670. \n\nIn 1724 there were 358 people in the community living in 15 houses. Twenty years later, while Jews were being expelled from Prague and other areas in Bohemia, there was a massacre in Ceska Lipa. Thirty-two Jews, including the rabbi, Yonah, were killed and 40 were wounded; a local fast was established to commemorate the massacre and a special prayer (selicha) was recited. This selicha graphically describes how the rabbi was \"dragged like a sheep to slaughter by his hair, while his beard was plucked\" before he was led through the city streets and executed. \n\nThe city's subsequent rabbis included Daniel Ehrmann (1851-1860) and Joel Mueller (1867-1872). In 1862 a Moorish-style synagogue was built. A new cemetery was established in 1905. \n\nThere were 130 Jewish families living in the city in 1852 and 112 in 1893. In 1912 there were 490 Jews living in the city and 301 in 1930 (2.7% of the total population). \n\nThe Sudeten crisis of February 1938 prompted many to leave the town. Shortly thereafter, on November 10, 1938, the synagogue was burned down and the cemetery desecrated.\n\nPOSTWAR\n\nIn 1959 a small Jewish community which had been established in Ceska Lipa after the war by Jews from Sub-Carpathian Ruthenia ceased to exist.

The cemetery building has been converted into a museum about the city's Jews. \n\nHISTORY\n\nJews were living in Ceske Budejovice at least since the 14th century, evidenced by the fact that in 1341 two Jews in the city were granted a tax remission for ten years. By 1390 the Jewish population was large enough that Jews were living in a separate quarter in the city. \n\nThe beginning of the 16th century saw outbreaks of violence against the Jews of Ceske Budejovice. There were anti-Jewish riots in 1505 and 1506; in 1505 a number of Jews were killed after a blood libel accusation, and 1506 saw a number of Jewish children being forcibly removed from their parents and baptized. Subsequently, the Jews were expelled from the city. Though they eventually received permission to attend fairs in 1538, they did not resettle in Ceske Budejovice until after the emancipation of Austro-Hungarian Jews in 1848. \n\nIn 1859 an organized kultusverein (organized Jewish communal life) was instituted. A cemetery was established in 1866 and a synagogue was built in Neo-Gothic style in 1868.\n\nIn 1902 there were 1,263 people in the community. By 1930 the Jewish population was 1,138 (2.6% of the total population). \n\nThe rabbis who served the community included Emil Krakauer (1905-1906) and Karl Thieberger (1906-1930).\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nIn June 1939, following the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, the offices of the Jewish community in Ceske Budejovice were closed down. As the Nuremberg Laws began to take effect, the Jews of Ceske Budejovice (like their coreligionists anywhere under Nazi occupation) were no longer allowed to attend school, to join cultural activities, and the places to which they could be admitted were restricted. During the summer of 1940, however, the Jewish community was able to rent an area on the Vlatava riverbank which became a \"Jewish swimming place,\" where Jewish children could swim every day and adults could swim on Sundays. On August 16, 1940 the Jews of the town were forced to relinquish their homes. \n\nOn April 18, 1942 there were 909 Jews deported to concentration and death camps. The Germans blew up the town's synagogue on June 5, 1942. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nAfter the war, a small congregation was reestablished in Ceske Budejovice under the supervision of the district rabbi of Prague. However, this reformed community ceased to exist after 1970 due to population decline.

dates from the 13th century and the privileges granted to the Jews of Cheb were successively endorsed by the kings of Bohemia, from Ottokar II in 1266 to Charles IV in 1347. Even in 1322, when the town was pawned to the king, the privileges granted to the Jews were explicitly included in the agreement, and reendorsed whenever the status of the town was reconfirmed. \n\nIn part due to this tolerance, by the 14th century the Jewish community of Cheb was made up of nearly 3,000 people. Nonetheless, the relative peace and quiet enjoyed by the Jewish community of Cheb would not last. Almost all of the town's Jews were killed during a massacre in 1350; thereafter, the Jewish street became known as \"Mordgaesschen\" (\"Murder Lane\"). Jews began to resettle in Cheb in 1352 and, though they were forbidden from living on the former Jewish street, things were temporarily calm. In 1364 Charles IV confirmed their possession of the synagogue and cemetery. Four Jewish representatives were elected to the town council in 1386. \n\nSigismund I also granted certain privileges to the Jews, but at the request of the townspeople he expelled the Jews from Cheb in 1430. After the expulsion, the synagogue was converted into a church. Jews were permitted to return to Cheb in 1435, but were again expelled in 1502. \n\nThough a few Jewish families continued to live in the town from the end of the 17th century until the middle of the 18th century, a significant congregation was not reestablished until after the Revolution of 1848, when the Jews under the Austro-Hungarian Empire were emancipated. Though the community quickly began to grow, anti-Semitism remained a persistent and widely-known problem, to the extent that the name \"Eger\" (the German name for Cheb) had become a byword for rabid anti-Semitism in the Hapsburg Empire. \n\nThere were 515 Jews living n Cheb in 1921 and 491 in 1930 (1.5% of the total population), of whom 75 declared their nationality as Jewish. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nDuring the Sudeten Crisis of 1938 many Jews left Cheb. On September 23rd of that year the synagogue was burned down.\n\nPOSTWAR\n\nA congregation of approximately 200 was organized in 1945 after the war, but dissolved in 1947. In 1962 there were ten Jewish families living in Cheb. \n\nIn 1969, a memorial for Jewish victims of the Holocaust was unveiled where the Jewish cemetery, which was destroyed by the Nazis, was once located.

and organized community had been established. When the community was threatened with expulsion in 1681, Abraham Lichtenstadt succeeded in having the ruling annulled.  \n\nA synagogue is mentioned in documents dating from 1645; later, in 1759, a new synagogue would be built in the Baroque style. Rabbi Abraham Broda served the community between 1690 and 1693. The community maintained a pinkas (a communal ledger), which was collected and written up in 1756 (it would later be published in 1910). A new cemetery was established in 1890. \n\nIn 1736 there were 22 Jewish families living in Chodova Plana. By 1767 that number had risen to 32 families, who occupied 12 houses. \n\nThe community established its own special prayer and fast day on the 13th of the Jewish month of Iyyar to commemorate the fact that the Jewish Quarter was spared during a major fire in 1733. \n\nThe noble Haimhausen family had authority over the town. Count Cajetan of Berchem-Haimhausen (1795-1863) was unusually friendly and helpful to the Jews of Chodova Plana. In 1843 he established an endowment whose purpose was to employ a rabbi \"of a modern school of thought with opinions on reform suited to our age but not in conflict with the laws of the country.\" In 1861 he also provided a fund to help the Jewish poor. In honor of his efforts, a memorial plaque was placed in the synagogue in honor of the Haimhausen family. \n\nIn 1818 there were 35 Jewish families living in Chodova Plana. By 1910 that number had risen to 230, though the population began to drop significantly shortly thereafter; by 1932 there were only 3 Jewish families living in the town (18 lived in nearby Plana). \n\nNotable members of the Jewish community of Chodova Plana include the Hoenigsberg family, Rabbi Joseph Breslau, and the Roman Catholic convert Johann Emanyel Veith. \n\nThe community of Drmoul (Duerrmaul) was closely affiliated with the community of Chodova Plana, and fell under its rabbinic authority. Drmoul included a Baroque-style synagogue build in 1801, as well as a cemetery dating back to ancient times. The Jews of Drmoul developed the spa amenities of Marienbad (Marianske Lazne), and were among the founders of the community of Marienbad. There were about 100 Jews living in Drmoul in 1896, and 48 in 1931. \n\nThe vast majority of the Jews of Chodova Plana and Drmoul left during the Sudeten crisis of 1938. The synagogue was burned down by the Nazis that same year. \n\n \n\n", "He": "\u05db\u05d5\u05d3\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4 \u05e4\u05dc\u05d0\u05e0\u05d4 CHODOVA PLANA\r\n\r\n(\u05d1\u05e9\u05de\u05d4

Otto (1879-1945), author, Zionist activist, born in Bruenn, Moravia (now Brno, in the Czech Republic), where he was raised. In Brno Abeles was one of the organizers of  Veritas, an organization of Jewish students, and among the founders of the Zionist movement in Bohemia and Moravia. He soon became part of Bertold Feiwel and Robert Strickers\u2019 circle in Zionist activities.\n \nAfter his studies at the University of Vienna Abeles was employed as legal advisor to the Austrian Railways. His flair for writing led him to move into journalism. He was one of the editors of the Zionist newspaper \"Die Welt\" and the \"Jueddische Zeitung\". He also wrote articles for the \"Yiddische National Zeitung\" and other newspapers.  Together with Stricker he founded the Zionist daily newspaper \"Wiener Morgenzeitung\". In 1926, Abeles became emissary for Keren Hayesod and lectured throughout Western Europe. From 1930 he served as director of Keren Hayesod in Amsterdam. Among his major works are \"Die Genesung\" (1920) a book of poems, \"Besuch in Eretz Israel\", a description of his first visit to Palestine (1926), and \"Zehn Juedinnen\" (1931), about famous Jewish women.\n\nAbeles died of exhaustion in 1945, shortly after his liberation from the Nazi concentration camp at Bergen Belsen.     \n \n", "He": "\u05de\u05e0\u05d4\u05d9\u05d2

Empire. Austerlitz first pursued a commercial career, but in 1887 he turned to journalism, joining the staff of the Vienna's \"Arbeitzeitung\", then still a weekly. In the early 1890s he undertook social work for the employees\u2019 union. In 1895 he was made editor of the political section of the \"Arbeitzeitung\", which now became a daily newspaper, and in 1906 he was appointed its editor in chief. Austerlitz held his post for twenty-five years, during which period the paper gained the reputation of being the best organ of the Socialist Internationale.\n\nHis total devotion to his journalistic activities made him to refuse, time and again, to become a candidate for the Reichstag. Only in 1919 did he become a member of the National Constitutional Assembly of Austria. In 1920 he was elected to the National Assembly, where he took part in the drafting of the Austrian Press Law.\n\nAusterlitz consistently refrained from participation in all Jewish topics, particularly national Jewish problems.

He studied in Fuerth and then went to  Prague where talmudists came to hear his daily talmudic discourses. In 1773 Banet settled in Nikolsburg where at age 21 he was made head of the beit din. From 1789 he was chief rabbi of Moravia and rabbi of Nikolsburg. His yeshiva attracted students from far and near and thousands came there to learn during the forty years it was headed by Banet.

Born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, Brod studied law and graduated in 1907 from the German University in Prague. \n\nHe was active in the Zionist movement from 1910 onwards and in 1918 he co-founded the National Council of the Jews of Czechoslovakia and was elected its vice president. He worked for the Czech government until 1924. \n\nBrod gradually began to focus his interests on literature and served as the theatre and music critic for the Prager Tagblatt between 1924-1939. At the same time he began developing his writing career. \n\nIn 1939 Brod fled to Eretz Israel, where he settled in Tel Aviv. From the time of his immigration until his death, he served as the artistic adviser of Habimah National Theatre and as music critic for Yedioth Chadashoth, a German language daily published in Tel Aviv.\n\nBrod is author of many writings including the philosophical work Heidentum, Christentum, Judentum (1921), twenty novels (including Der Frau, nach der man sich sehnt, 1927, and Tycho Brahes Weg zu Gott, 1916), plays (including Die Koenigin Esther, 1918, Die Faelscher, 1920), biographies (including Franz Kafka, Leos Janacek, 1924-25, and the composer and Brod\u2019s own piano teacher, Adolph Schreiber) and an autobiography (1960). \n\nHe also arranged for publication of Kafka\u2019s writings.

Edelstein went to Palestine in 1937 but was disappointed with his work there and returned to Prague. When the Germans entered Prague in March 1939 he was the Jewish official dealing with emigration to Palestine and became the Jewish representative in contacts with the Germans. He was permitted to travel abroad and everywhere warned Jewish leaders of the dangerous situation that had developed. He had many opportunities to remain abroad but felt his place was in Czechoslovakia. Edelstein did what he could to prevent the deportation of Czech Jews and saw the establishment of the Theresienstadt Ghetto as an achievement in this direction, not realizing that the Germans saw it only as a temporary destination. He himself arrived there in December 1941 and became the first head of its Judenrat.

At the age of seven, his parents moved to Vienna, Austria. Ellenbogen studied medicine and became a physician at the age of twenty three (1886). \n\nAfter graduation he entered politics joining the newly established Social-Democratic Party, where he was member of the Executive Board, from 1891. He was elected to the Reichsrat (1901), and later (1918) to the Austrian Parliament, until the government of Dolfuss desolved it in 1934. During his 33 years of parliamentary activity, Ellenbogen contributed to a number of important political decissions: he helped passing the Universal Franchise Bill (1907); at the end of WWI he was instrumental in the negotiations with the Hungarian government securing the safety of the population of Vienna from plague. He became Undersecretary for Commerce in 1919, and later in 1921 succeeded Otto Bauer as secretary for socialization in the capacity of Cabinet member. During the 1920s he was chief of the electrification of the state railroads. \n\nAfter the Anschluss in 1938, Ellenbogen fled to France, and then he immigrated to the USA in 1940. \n \n ", "He": "\u05d0\u05dc\u05e0\u05d1\u05d5\u05d2\u05df, \u05d5\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4\u05dc\u05dd (1863 \u2013 1951)\n\u05e4\u05d5\u05dc\u05d9\u05d8\u05d9\u05e7\u05d0\u05d9\n\n\u05e0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3 \u05d1\u05d1\u05e8\u05e6\u05dc\u05d1, \u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05d1\u05d9\u05d4 (\u05db\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d1\u05e8\u05e4\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc\u05d9\u05e7\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e6'\u05db\u05d9\u05ea). \u05d1\u05d2\u05d9\u05dc \u05e9\u05d1\u05e2 \u05e2\u05d1\u05e8 \u05e2\u05dd \u05d4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d5\u05d5\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4, \u05d0\u05d5\u05e1\u05d8\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4. \u05d0\u05dc\u05e0\u05d1\u05d5\u05d2\u05df \u05dc\u05de\u05d3 \u05e8\u05e4\u05d5\u05d0\u05d4 \u05d5\u05e0\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05dc\u05e8\u05d5\u05e4\u05d0 \u05d1\u05d2\u05d9\u05dc 23, \u05d1- 1888. \n\n\u05d1\u05ea\u05d5\u05dd \u05dc\u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d4\u05d7\u05dc \u05d1\u05e4\u05e2\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea \u05e4\u05d5\u05dc\u05d9\u05d8\u05d9\u05ea \u05d5\u05d4\u05e6\u05d8\u05e8\u05e3 \u05dc\u05de\u05e4\u05dc\u05d2\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e1\u05d5\u05e6\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc \u05d3\u05de\u05d5\u05e7\u05e8\u05d8\u05d9\u05ea \u05e9\u05d0\u05da \u05d6\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d5\u05e7\u05de\u05d4. \u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d7\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d1\u05d5\u05d5\u05e2\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d4\u05de\u05e0\u05d4\u05dc\u05ea \u05de\u05e9\u05e0\u05ea 1891. \u05e0\u05d1\u05d7\u05e8 \u05dc\u05e8\u05d9\u05d9\u05db\u05e1\u05e8\u05d0\u05d8 \u05d1- 1901, \u05d5\u05d1- 1918 \u05dc\u05e4\u05e8\u05dc\u05de\u05e0\u05d8 \u05d4\u05d0\u05d5\u05e1\u05d8\u05e8\u05d9, \u05e2\u05d3 \u05dc\u05e4\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05e7\u05d5 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d9\u05d3\u05d9 \u05de\u05de\u05e9\u05dc\u05ea \u05d3\u05d5\u05dc\u05e4\u05d5\u05e1 \u05d1- 1934. \u05d1\u05de\u05e9\u05da 33 \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05dc \u05e4\u05e2\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea \u05e4\u05e8\u05dc\u05de\u05e0\u05d8\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea \u05d0\u05dc\u05e0\u05d1\u05d5\u05d2\u05df \u05ea\u05e8\u05dd \u05dc\u05de\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05d4\u05db\u05e8\u05e2\u05d5\u05ea \u05e4\u05d5\u05dc\u05d9\u05d8\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d7\u05e9\u05d5\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea: \u05e1\u05d9\u05d9\u05e2 \u05dc\u05d4\u05e2\u05d1\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d0\u05ea \u05d7\u05d5\u05e7 \u05d4\u05d6\u05d9\u05db\u05d9\u05d5\u05df \u05d4\u05d1\u05d9\u05df \u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05d9 (1907); \u05d1\u05e1\u05d9\u05d5\u05de\u05d4 \u05e9\u05dc \u05de\u05dc\u05d7\u05de\u05ea \u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05d4\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e0\u05d5\u05d3\u05e2 \u05dc\u05d5 \u05ea\u05e4\u05e7\u05d9\u05d3 \u05de\u05e4\u05e9\u05d9\u05e2 \u05d1\u05ea\u05d4\u05dc\u05d9\u05db\u05d9 \u05d4\u05de\u05e9\u05d0 \u05d5\u05de\u05ea\u05df \u05e2\u05dd \u05d4\u05de\u05de\u05e9\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d4\u05d5\u05e0\u05d2\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea \u05d1\u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u05e8\u05ea \u05d1\u05d8\u05d7\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e9\u05dc \u05d0\u05d5\u05db\u05dc\u05d5\u05e1\u05d9\u05d9\u05ea \u05d5\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05de\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e4\u05e8\u05e2\u05d5\u05ea. \u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05e0\u05ea\u05de\u05e0\u05d4 \u05dc\u05ea\u05ea-\u05e9\u05e8 \u05dc\u05de\u05e1\u05d7\u05e8 \u05d1- 1919. \u05d1- 1921 \u05ea\u05e4\u05e1 \u05d0\u05ea \u05de\u05e7\u05d5\u05e8\u05d5 \u05e9\u05dc \u05d0\u05d5\u05d8\u05d5 \u05d1\u05d0\u05d5\u05d0\u05e8 \u05db\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d5\u05d7\u05d1\u05e8 \u05e7\u05d1\u05d9\u05e0\u05d8. \u05d1\u05e9\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4- 1920 \u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05d7\u05e9\u05de\u05dc \u05d5\u05de\u05e1\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d1\u05e8\u05d6\u05dc. \n\n\u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d0\u05e0\u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05e1 \u05d1- 1938, \u05e0\u05de\u05dc\u05d8 \u05d0\u05dc\u05e0\u05d1\u05d5\u05d2\u05df \u05dc\u05e6\u05e8\u05e4\u05ea, \u05d5\u05de\u05e9\u05dd \u05d4\u05d9\u05d2\u05e8 \u05dc\u05d0\u05e8\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea \u05d1- 1940.

He studied in the famous yeshivot of Nitra and Pressburg (Bratislava), Slovakia (then in Czecho\u00adslovakia), where he was ordained a rabbi in 1937. During WW 2 he was sent to a Hungarian forcd labour camp, transferred to the Eastern Front and attached to the German OT and Wermacht. He was liberated by the Soviet Army in 1945. In the same year he joined the Haganah in Prague, Czech Republic. \n\nEngel immigrated with his family to Israel in 1948, took part in the War of Independence of Israel, and in 1949 joined the Permanent forces as a Chaplain and Administrative Officer at Tel Hashomer until 1956, when he accepted a call from South Africa to come and provide spiritual services to a small country community. Between 1956-1970 he served the Hebrew congregations of Standerton, Welkom and Witbank as rabbi, teacher and shochet. In 1970, Engel was appointed as National Rabbi of Country communities. In this role he traveled the length and breadth of South Africa and South West Africa in an attempt to reach every isolated Jew or Jewish community and managed to provide them with a vast spectrum of spiritual and educational services. \n\nHis two major contributions were: the provision of Jewish educational audio-visual material including a magazine for children which he edited, and the location and mapping out of all Jewish Cemeteries. This included the registration of every person buried therein, ensuring that each grave had a tombstone and arranging for proper maintenance.\n\nDespite his intention to retire in 1982, Rabbi Engel, nevertheless, accepted the calls of the Potchefstroom and Klerksdorp communities where he officiated until 1993. Altogether, he devoted himself to the S. African Jewish Community for 37 years. Wherever he lived, his home was open to all, where true \"hachnasat orchim\" was practiced, especially in the communities wherein there existed a military unit, with Jewish soldiers: they were all befriended and entertained at the Rabbi's house. Engel was a very friendly, kind and caring person with outstanding abilities to listen, empathize and give appropriate advice.

At the age of 18 he was appointed rabbi of Kromeriz and then of Mainz, Germany, before settling in Vienna, Austria, as court purveyor, supplying arms and other commodities to the authorities. \n\nEskeles succeeded his father as chief rabbi of Moravia and in 1725 succeeded his father-in-law as chief rabbi of Hungary, working out of Vienna. In 1727 a community from Moravia asked him whether Jewish law permitted the use of razors to shave  beards.He did not permit it.\n\nEskeles intervened with the court on behalf of his co-religionists who were threatened with expulsion from Moravia in 1742 and from Prague and Bohemia in 1745. The decrees were withdrawn.

He received a Talmudic and rabbinical training at the Yeshiva of Moses Sofer \"Hatam Sofer\" in Pressburg (Pozsony, now Bratislava, in Slovakia). After an unsuccessful venture into business, Fassel was appointed rabbi of Prossnitz in 1836 and was confirmed in office by the government despite the opposition by chief rabbi, Nehemiah Trebitsch.\n\nDespite his early Orthodox training, Fassel was an ardent advocate of Reform. He instituted certain changes in the synagogue ritual and preached in the German language. In 1845 he declined an offer to become a Conservative rabbi as associate of Abraham Geiger in Bresslau, Germany (now Wroclaw, in Poland). He participated in the preparation of the rabbinical assembly in Bresslau, but in a letter to Geiger (1846) criticized the radical Reform views of the first two rabbinical assemblies. In 1851 Fassel succeeded Leopold Loew as rabbi in Nagykanizsa, Hungary, where he served until his death.\n\nFassel, a fruitful writer was the author of a number of sermons and other articles published in \"Orient\", \"Neuzeit\", \"Ben Chananja\" and other Hungarian Jewish periodicals. Of exceptional value were the articles which he wrote concerning the Talmud and rabbinical ethics. Fassel always tried to find a basis in the Talmud for the reforms which he introduced. His works included \"Choreb Bezajon\"; \"Briefe eines Juedischen Gelehrten und Rabbiners ueber das Werk 'Choreb' von S. R. Hirsch\" (Leipzig, 1839); \"Mischpete El: Das mosaisch-rabbinische Zivilrecht\" (1852-54); \"Assot Mischpat: Das mosaisch-rabbinische Gerichtsverfahren in zivilrechtlichen Sachen\" (1859); \"Das Mosche Wejisrael: Die mosaische-rabbinische Religionslehre\" (1859); \"Divre Elohim Chaj: Neun Derush-Vortraage\" (1868); \"Weschaftu Wehizzilu: Das mosaisch-rabbinische Strafrecht und strafrechtliche Gerichtsverfahren\" (Nagykanizsa, 1870).

Shortly after the end of World War I he was made professor. For a time he was visiting professor at the University of Ghent in Belgium and in  1936 he was appointed Dramatic Director of the Prague National Theatre. He died of heart failure while reading of the German invasion of Austria.\n\nFischer edited several literary reviews and wrote articles for several Czech magazines. His writings included two books on Heine, studies of von Kleist and Nietzche. He wrote more than 12 volumes of poetry. Despite his assimilated background he was always aware of his Jewish roots. Many of his works reflect this. He translated into Czech the works of Goethe, Heine, von Kleist, Nietzche, Schiller and Bruckner.

Following his studies in Vienna he moved to Prague (now in Czech Republic), where he was a professor of theoretical physics at the German University of Prague (1912). \n\nAfter the takeover by the Nazis he left for the United States in 1938. He was appointed to the faculty of Harvard University, where he taught mathematics and physics. Frank rose to become a full Professor and was recognized for his integration of physics and philosophy. \n\nHis most famous work was on philosophy of science in which he attempted to clarify the philosophical foundations of the natural sciences. He was against the compartmentalization  of individual sciences. He also pointed out the neglected areas between the individual sciences. Frank had been a personal friend of Albert Einstein and in 1947 wrote a biography \"Einstein - His life and Times\". He opposed a limited form of logical positivism and emphasized instead that the principles of physics are the product of free human imagination and that they are symbols \u2013 in this he agreed with Einstein. In his later years he was especially interested in the sociological, historical, cultural and psychological aspects of the natural sciences. He was considered an excellent teacher and a very clear writer. His many books are an important source for the history of logical positivism and empiricism in the 20th century.       \n ", "He": "1884 \u2013 1966\n\u05e4\u05d9\u05d6\u05d9\u05e7\u05d0\u05d9,

{"En": "Frankel, Zecharias (1801\u20131875), rabbi and historian, born in Prague, Czech Republic (Then part of the Austrian Empire) to a family of distinguished Talmud scholars, and who is considered by many to be the founder of the concept of Conservative Judaism. Frankel was the founder and the most eminent member of the school of historical Judaism, which advocates freedom of research, while upholding the authority of traditional Jewish belief and practice. He was educated in Prague at the yeshivah of Bezalel Ronsperg and then went to Budapest, Hungary, where he studied philosophy, natural sciences and philology at the university between 1825 and 1830. In 1832 he became rabbi of Litomerice, being the first rabbi in Bohemia with a university degree and who gave sermons in German. In 1847 his important work on the Jewish oath, \"Die Eidesleistung bei den Juden in Theologischer und Historischer Beziehung\" showed the origin of the law in Saxony and other states which discriminated against Jews and claimed that they were not trustworthy witnesses in court. Similarly, the law of Prussia stipulated that the testimony of a Jew against a Christian was valid only in civil cases, and in these only when they involved a sum less than fifty thalers. It was due to Frankel's work, that this  discrimination was abolished. Frankel held that reason based on scholarship, and not mere desire on the part of the community, must be the justification for any reforms within Judaism. He introduced some slight modifications in prayer services such as the introduction of a choir of boys, and the like, but he was opposed to any change which was incompatible with  traditionalism. He strongly denounced the decision of  Rabbi Joseph Hoffmann of Saxe-Meiningen, who permitted Jewish high-school boys to write on the Sabbath.   In 1836 he was made chief rabbi of Dresden in Saxony, and in 1843 he was invited to the chief rabbinate at Berlin, Germany, a position that had been vacant since 1800 since the Prussian government \u201ctolerated\u201d Judaism, but refused to give it full legal recognition.  \n  \nFrankel's position in the controversy on the new Hamburg siddur (prayer book) of 1842 displeased both parties. The  liberals were unhappy because, instead of declaring that their prayer-book was in accord with Jewish tradition, he pointed out inconsistencies from the traditional prayer book while the Orthodox were dissatisfied because he declared that certain changes were permissible. \nIn an 1845 article published in a Frankfurt-am-Main journal, he announced his withdrawal from the rabbinical conference then in session in the city since they had passed a resolution declaring the Hebrew language unnecessary for public worship. This letter made Frankel one of the leaders of the Conservative movement in Germany. His principles were set out in his monthly \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr die Religi\u00f6sen Interessen des Judenthums\" magazine which he published from 1844 onward. But Frankel's attitude antagonized both opposing sides. He aimed at a synthesis between historical traditional  Judaism and contemporary needs through gradual organic reform.   \n\nFrankel was chosen president of the new rabbinical seminary at Breslau (now Wroclaw, in Poland) in 1854. There his \u201cpositivist-historical\u201d school greatly influenced the Conservative movement in the USA. In the seminary he defined the standards, curriculum and qualifications for modern rabbinical training. Frankel attempted to use modern scientific methods and studies in order to improve understanding of the Talmud. This is seen in his introduction to the Mishnah, \"Darke ha-Mishnah\" (1859) which is a systematic history of early rabbinical literature and theology.  His outline of rabbinical marriage law, \"Grundlinien des Mosaisch-Talmudischen Eherechts\" (1860), was meant to serve as a text-book on that subject. Frankel's studies in the history of Talmudic literature had convinced him that the neglect of the Jerusalem Talmud was a serious drawback in the critical investigation of the development of Talmudic law. To rectify this he published in 1870 his introduction to the Jerusalem Talmud under the title \"Mevo ha-Yerushalmi\". He then began to write new commentary to the Jerusalem Talmud, but only three treatises appeared before his death.\n\nGeiger, leader of the German Liberal Jews of the time and who had pressed for the establishment of the new seminary  had vigorously opposed Frankel's appointment. At the other extreme Samson Raphael Hirsch, immediately on the opening of the seminary, addressed an open letter to Frankel, demanding a statement as to the religious principles which would guide the instruction at the new institution. Frankel ignored the challenge. When the fourth volume of Gr\u00e4tz's history appeared in 1856, Hirsch impeached the orthodoxy of the new institution. There followed a ferment of accusations, attacks and counter attacks which filled the ages of the Jewish press of the time. Hirsch wrote a series of articles in which he took exception to Frankel's definition of rabbinical tradition. In reply Frankel pointed out that Rabbenu Asher had stated that not everything called a \"law\", and reputed as given by Moses on Mount Sinai, was actually of Mosaic origin.   Hirsch was supported by various Orthodox rabbis, such as Ezriel Hildesheimer, Solomon Klein of Colmar, and B. H. Auerbach, while some of Frankel's supporters, like Salomon Juda Rappoport, were half-hearted. The general Jewish public remained indifferent to the whole controversy, but Frankel's position was gradually strengthened by the number of graduates from the seminary who earned reputations as scholars and as representatives of Conservative Judaism. \n\nHe wrote many articles for the two magazines which he edited, the \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr die Religi\u00f6sen Interessen des Judenthums\" (1844-46), and the \"Monatsschrift\", which was founded in 1851, and which he edited until 1868, when Gr\u00e4tz succeeded him as editor. \n", "He": "1801 \u2013 1875\n\u05e8\u05d1

He attended yeshiva in Leipnik and afterwards attended the Jewish Theological Seminary in Breslau, Germany (now Wroclaw, in Poland). \n\nIn 1877 Frankl-Gruen was appointed rabbi of Kromenz, a position which he held until 1911 when he retired and went to live in Vienna, Austria. In Kromenz he taught in the Jewish school and organized a junior congregation with the students conducting the services by themselves. A talented speaker he gave and subsequently published a number of sermons in German between 1882 and 1910 including one marking the 25th anniversary of the accession of Emperor Franz Joseph in 1882. He wrote several books on the Psalms and a study of Yehuda HaLevi\u2019s Ethics.\n\nDuring his thirty four years as rabbi of Kromenz he searched many libraries and archives in Moravia for information on the Jews in the region. The result, his three volume \"Geschichte der Juden in Kremsler\" is probably the most important study of Moravian Jewry. He wrote a study of the history of Jewish emancipation in Austria and a history of the Jewish community of Uhersky Brod. In 1903 be published a book in which he analyzed contemporary Jewry. \n\nIn 1899 there was a ritual murder accusation in Kromenz. Frankl-Gruen spoke out against anti-Semites in the area and in 1901 he wrote a book which attacked the British anti-Semitic writer Houston Stewart Chamberlain.

In 1859, the Freud family moved to Leipzig, Germany, but a year after, they settled in Vienna, the city where Sigmund Freud was to live for the next 78 years.\n\nFreud graduated from the Sperl Gymnasium in 1873 and turned to medicine as a career studying at the University of Vienna. There he was in contact with Ernst von Brucke (1819-1892), a leading physiologist of his time. In 1882, Freud entered the General Hospital in Vienna as a clinical assistant and three years later was appointed lecturer in neuropathology.\n\nFreud continued his studies of neuropathology at the Salpetriere clinic in Paris in 1885 under the guidance of Jean-Martin Charcot (1825-1893). Freud's acquaintance with Charcot's theories and practice had a significant influence on his career helping him to concentrate his research on the mind as source of neurotic conditions rather than the brain. A short time after his return from Paris, Freud married Martha Bernays, a descendant of a famous Jewish family whose ancestors included Heinrich Heine and a chief rabbi of Hamburg.\n\nHaving settled at 19 Bergasse in Vienna, his home for more than fifty years, Freud began his collaboration with Josef Breuer (1842-1925). One of Breuer's patients, Bertha Pappenheim, or Anna O., as she is known in the psychoanalytical literature, was later instrumental in developing Freud's method of free association.\n\nFreud's fame came with the publication in 1899 of The Interpretation of Dreams who proved to turn into one of the most influential works not only in the field of psychoanalysis, but also in many other scientific, cultural and artistic disciplines. His prolific career is illustrated by a long list of publications, among them the best known are \"The Psychopathology of Everyday Life\" (1904); \"Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious\"(1905); \"Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality\"(1905); \"The Origin and Development of Psychoanalysis\"(1910); \"Beyond the Pleasure Principle\" (1920); \"The Ego and the Id\" (1923). However, Freud also disclosed a keen interest in the field of sociology and social psychology, as proven by a number of significant essays: \"Totem und Tabu\"(1913); \"Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego\"(1921); \"The Future of an Illusion\" (1927); \"Civilization and Its Discontents\"(1930); \"Moses and Monotheism\"(1938).\n\nFreud was not a practicing Jew, but he never rejected his religion. In an interview with George Sylvester Viereck in 1926 and published a year later, Freud clearly stated his identity: \"My language is German. My culture, my attainments are German. I considered myself German intellectually, until I noticed the growth of anti-Semitic prejudice in Germany and German Austria. Since that time I prefer to call myself a Jew.\"\n\nFreud encountered many anti-Semitic incidents during his lifetime, but the worst occurred after the Nazis' seizure of power in Germany. Freud's books were denounced as \"expressions of Jewish science\" and were publicly burned as early as 1933. When Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938, Freud was forced to flee the country and with the help of friends settled in England. He died of cancer on September 23, 1939, three weeks after the outbreak of the World War II.\n\\ ", "He": "\u05e4\u05e8\u05d5\u05d9\u05d3, \u05d6\u05d9\u05d2\u05de\u05d5\u05e0\u05d3 (1856-1939),

He joined the pan-German movement of Schoenerer, but because of the latter anti-Semitic ideas he left that movement. Because of his political radical opinion and publicity, Friedjung was fired from his job by the Education Ministry in 1881. \n\nHe founded and edited the weekly \"Deutsche Wochenschrift\" for three years. Later he became editor in chief of the \"Deutsche Zeitung\", the organ of the Deutschnationale Partei four four years. He was also member of the Vienna City Council, but after a while left politics altogether and started writing history books about the German Confederation, the Second German Empire and the era of Franz Joseph. One of these books, \"Der Kampf um die Vorherrschaft in Deutschland\" (1859-1869), published in two vollumes in 1907, went through ten editions, and made him famous outside Austria.

He studied at Budapest, Hungary, at the yeshiva of Moses Mintz. Goitein was appointed rabbi in Hogyesz, Hungary. His reputation amongst rabbis was mainly due to his \"Kesef Nivhar\", an examination of and commentary on some 160 Talmudic themes published in Prague in 1827-1828 and reprinted in 1966. Although he was a product of the Hungarian method of study, the nearness of his study methodology to that customary in the Lithuanian yeshivas made his work very popular in Talmudic circles.\n\nIn 1841 Goitein resigned his post in Hogyesz, but was succeeded by his son Zvi Hirsch also known as Hermann (1805-1860), who was the author of \"Yedei Moshe\" (1905) on the 613 commandments.  Zvi Hirsch's son Eliyahu Menachem Goitein (1837-1902) succeed his father and grandfather in the same position. One of Elyahu\u2019s sons, Hirsch (1863-1903), served as rabbi in Copenhagen, Denmark, and was the author of \"Optimismus und Pessimismus in der juedischen Religionsphilosophie\". Another son of Eliyahu Menachem, Eduard Goitein, became rabbi in Burgkunstadt, Bavaria, Germany, and wrote \"Das Vergeltungsprincip im biblischen und talmudischen Strafrecht\" (1893).

In 1924 he took over the publishing house of his uncle Max Hickl, the \"J\u00fcdischer Buch- und Kunstverlag\", in Brno, Czechoslovakia, and opened an office of the company in Prague in 1932. For a time, Gold also edited the newspaper \"J\u00fcdische Volksstimme\" (Jewish People\u2019s Voice).\n\nWhen Gold saw that many small Jewish communities in the country were struggling and were in danger of collapsing, he  set out to preserve their achievements by writing and  publishing their histories. The first  book of this project was  \"The Jews and Jewish Communities of Moravia in Past and Present\", published in 1929. Other volumes followed on Bratislava (1932) and Bohemia (1934), the latter with some articles in Czech. Gold also edited the historical journal \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr die Geschichte der Juden in der Tschechoslowakei\" (\"Journal of the History of the Jews in Czechoslovakia\"),published in 1938.\n\nIn 1940, he moved to Palestine. After the conclusion of World War II, he  founded a new publishing house, \"Olamenu\" (\"Our World\") and through it he continued to publish his memorial volumes of the Jewish communities of Eastern Europe. Gold himself wrote a history of the Jews in Vienna, \"Geschichte der Juden in Wien\" (1966), and edited works on Bukovina (two vols., 1958\u20131962), Burgenland (1970), and Austria, all of which had special emphasis on small Jewish communities in small villages (1971). Gold\u2019s last such book, which he compiled himself, was, like his first, on Moravia (1974). He also published and edited a new historical journal, \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr die Geschichte der Juden\" (\"Journal of the History of the Jews\"; 1964\u20131974). Among his other publications were memorial volumes for the historian Nathan M. Gelber (1963; largely in Hebrew) and the writer Max Brod (1969). The works which he wrote and edited are a major source of information about the destroyed Jewish communities of central Europe. \n", "He": "1895 \u2013 1974\n\u05de\u05d5\u05e6\u05d9\u05d0

Austria-Hungary, today in the Czech Republic). He studied law in Prague and was an active member of the Zionist Bar Kochba Association. He helped to found the Theodor Herzl Association in 1909 and chaired this first Czech Zionist student group in 1909\u20131910. He served in the Austro-Hungarian army during World War I and was wounded. After the war, he opened a law office in Prague.\n\nGoldstein was a cofounder and vice president of \"Zidovska Strana\" (the Jewish Party of Czechoslavakia), vice president of the Central Committee of the Zionist Confederation in Czechoslovakia, a member of the presidium of the Jewish religious community in Prague, as well as a member of the Prague city council. Following the death of Ludv\u00edk Singer in 1931, who was the representative of \"Zidovska Strana\" in the Czechoslovak parliament, Goldstein was chosen to be his replacement. He was reelected in his own right in 1935, when he became a member of the Social Democratic faction in parliament. He used his position to champion the rights of Jews. He lobbied for financial support of the Jewish schools in Slovakia, he protested against antisemitic incidents and demanded greater political rights for Jewish refugees from Germany. He was, however, bitterly opposed by both the assimilationists and the extreme orthodox. In 1937 Goldstein and Chayim Kugel helped to formulate a law which reorganized Jewish religious communities in Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia.\n\nAs a Zionist, Goldstein supported the politics of Chaim Weizmann and served on the Zionist General Council (1931\u20131935) on behalf of the Progressive General Zionist faction. In 1939, he immigrated to Palestine, where he practiced law.

After his studies he was appointed professor of classical philology at the University of Vienna. He held this position for twenty eight years (1873-1901). He was elected to the Academy of Science in 1882. Gomperz wrote about the Greek philosophy, and his important work \"Griechische Denker\" (3 volumes) which describes the history of the Greek philosophy from its roots until Aristotle, set in the context of the development of the Greek and ancient civilizations, has been translated in many languages and is thought to be one of the basic works in the field. \n\nGomperz was also active in politics, and served as a Liberal member of the Upper House of the Austrian Parliament. In Jewish affairs he opposed Herzl and the Zionism strongly, and was very much in favour of assimilation. \n\nGomperz's biography and letters were published by his son Heinrich Gomperz.(1873-1942), who too was a philosopher. Heinrich was baptised, and was a professor in Vienna until 1934, when he refused to join Dolfuss\u2019 Fatherland Front. He immigrated to the USA (1938). Heinrich published many works in addition to his father\u2019s biography, including a study on the Greek philosophy and a work on Socrates Philosophical  Studies (1953).

In 1816 he was awarded  a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Pest (1816) and went on to study medicine in Vienna, Austria, specializing in diseases of the eyes.From 1825 to 1829 he practiced at Teltsch, Moravia, where he also founded a hospital. Returning to his native Nagyvarad, Grosz was appointed head of the Jewish hospital, where he established a free clinic for the poor which he maintained at his own expense until his death. He is said to have personally treated more than 40,000 patients, and performed 1,500 successful operations for the removal of eye cataracts.\n \nThe Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph visited Grosz in 1856 and bestowed a medal upon the hospital. To commemorate his services to the nation, an oil painting of Grosz, was acquired by the National Museum in Budapest. The Jewish community of Nagyvarad erected a marble plate in his honor in the local Jewish hospital.\n \nGrosz wrote extensively on ophthalmology. His principal published works include \"Dissertatio inaug, chemico-pharmacologico-medica de chinina\" (1826); \"Statisztikai adatok a Nagyvaradon 1830 ota letezo szegeny vakok gyogyintezete mukodeserol\"  (\"Statistical Data on the Activities of the Health Institute for the Poor Blind, which has existed in Nagyvarad since 1830\") (1846); \"Die Augenkrankheiten des grossen Ebenen Ungarns\" (\"Eye Diseases of the Majority of regular citizens of Hungary\" (1857).

He completed his studies through high school and in 1899 moved to Vienna, Austria, to study law. He also became interested in studying literature, which he pursued at the same time. Following graduation, he decided to forego the practice of law. He chose instead, to work in the theatre. \n\nGruenbaum began writing librettos for operetta in 1903. He took small roles in various theatres and theatre groups. By 1906, he had moved up to cabaret theatre and became the emcee at the Souterrain in Vienna. The theatre in Berlin also opened for him in several theatres under the direction of Rudolf Nelson. Nelson recognized Gruenbaum's talent for cabaret work and in 1910, he appeared as emcee in Nelson\u2019s \u2018Chat Noir,' in the \u2018Hoelle\u2019 and in the \u2018Simpl\u2019 theater, Vienna. \n\nWith the outbreak of  World War I Gruenbaum volunteered for the army. He was promoted to the rank a 1st Reserve Lieutenant and received distinctions for his service. After the war, he returned to cabaret performance working in both Vienna and Berlin theatres, such as the Simpl and the Ronacher. He married Lilly Herzel in 1916 who became his partner in cabaret routines. Between 1920-1933, he worked as revue and cabaret author, also as emcee in cabarets, primarily in Berlin and Vienna, catering to an intellectual and literary clientele. He acted in films and became a scriptwriter. Gruenbaum collaborated with Paul Morgan and Karl Farkas, with whom he developed the double emcee format. For a while, he acted as manager of the \u2018Simpl.' In 1933, he settled in Vienna. Gruenbaum made many guest performances in various localities, including Prague. From 1934 until 1938 he was co-manager, with Karl Farkas, of the \u2018Simpl.' \n\nFollowing the occupation of Austria by Nazi Germany in May 1938, Gruenbaum and his wife attempted to escape across the border with Czechoslovakia. Their effort failed. The Nazis arrested him in Vienna and sent him to the concentration camp of Dachau. In September of the same year, they transferred him to Buchenwald concentration camp. There, together with Paul Morgan and Hermann Leopoldi, he formed a cabaret group to help entertain the inmates.\nIn October 1940, he was sent back to Dachau where, according to some records, he supposedly died of \"paralysis of the heart\" on January 14, 1941.

A survivor of the Nazi Theresienstadt Concentration Camp, at the age of 110 was the world's oldest known Holocaust survivor and pianist. \n\nHer parents, Friedrich Herz, a merchant, and Sofie, who was highly educated and moved in circles of well-known writers ran a cultural salon, and as a child Herz met writers, philosophers, and composers including Gustav Mahler and Franz Kafka. \n\nHerz had a twin sister, Mariana, and two brothers. Herz's older sister Irma taught her how to play piano, which she studied diligently, and the pianist Artur Schnabel, a friend of the family, encouraged her to pursue a career as a classical musician; a choice she decided to make.She went on to study under V\u00e1clav \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n, at the Prague German Music Conservatory where she was the youngest pupil. Herz married the businessman and amateur musician Leopold Sommer in 1931; the couple had a son, Stephan (later known as Raphael,1937\u20132001). \n\nShe began giving concerts and making a name for herself across Europe until the Nazis took over Prague, as they did not allow Jews to perform in public, join music competitions or teach non-Jewish pupils. After the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovaskia, most of Herz-Sommer's family and friends emigrated to Palestine, but Herz-Sommer stayed in Prague to care for her ill mother, Sophie, aged 72, who was arrested and killed. In July 1943 Herz was sent to Theresienstadt  where she played in more than 100 concerts along with other musicians, for prisoners and guards. She commented that \n\u201cWe had to play because the Red Cross came three times a year. The Germans wanted to show its representatives that the situation of the Jews in Theresienstadt was good. Whenever I knew that I had a concert, I was happy. Music is magic. We performed in the council hall before an audience of 150 old, hopeless, sick and hungry people. They lived for the music. It was like food to them. If they hadn\u2019t come [to hear us], they would have died long before. As we would also have died.\"\n\nHerz-Sommer was billeted with her son during their time at the camp, he was one of only a few children to survive Theresienstadt. Her husband died of typhus in Dachau  in 1944, six weeks before the camp was liberated. After the Soviet liberation of Theresienstadt in 1945, Herz and Raphael returned to Prague and in March 1949 emigrated to Israel to be reunited with some of her family, including her twin sister, Mariana. Herz lived in Israel for nearly 40 years, working as a music teacher at the Jerusalem Academy of Music until moving to London in 1986. Her son Raphael, an accomplished cellist and conductor, died in 2001, aged 64, in Israel at the end of a concert tour. He was survived by his widow and two sons.\n\nIn London, Herz-Sommer lived close to her family in a one-room flat in London visited almost daily by her closest friends, her grandson Ariel Sommer, and daughter-in-law Genevieve Sommer. She practised playing the piano three hours a day until the end of her life.

He served as Rabbi of Karcag, Tiszabo, and from 1861 of Obuda (Alt-Ofen) (now part of Budapest), where he was also appointed director of a yeshiva. \n\nAt that time Hungarian Jewry was in a state of unrest and Hirsch was urged by the government to make peace between the conflicting parties. He helped to organize the Jewish elementary school system and to prepare a curriculum for the Budapest Rabbinical Seminary.He attempted to mediate between the progressive and Orthodox trends in Hungarian Jewry, and played the role of conciliator at the General Jewish Congress of Hungary in 1868-69. \n\nFrom 1880 Hirsch served the community of Prague, Czech Republic, but being too conservative for the community he accepted in 1889 the chief rabbinate of Hamburg, Germany, where he founded a high school for girls.

In 1841he became Rabbi of Aurich and Osnabrueck and from 1846 to 1851 lived in Nikolsburg as Chief Rabbi of Moravia. Despite his Orthodoxy, his modern innovations caused a rift with the extreme Orthodox community and he moved to Frankfurt on Main. There he organized an autonomous Orthodox community (separate from the Reform who dominated Frankfurt Jewry) and this became the model for other separatist Orthodox communities throughout Germany. In 1876 he obtained official legislation that gave legal recognition to these Orthodox communities. Hirsch was the founder of Neo-Orthodoxy whose motto was 'Torah with secular knowledge', which became the forerunner of modern Orthodoxy. \nWhile remaining Orthodox, he advocated modernization within its framework. He created a network of schools in this spirit and translated key works of Jewish tradition into German, providing them with commentaries that proved highly influential.", "He": "\u05e8\u05d1

Czech Republic (then part of the Austrian Empire). He studied Talmud at yeshivot in Prague, Pressburg (today Bratislava, Slovakia),and Gross-Glogau, and then when aged 17, he began the study of secular literature. Homberg decided to become a teacher for which he prepared himself in Berlin, Germany. In 1779 he became tutor to Moses Mendelssohn's eldest son, Joseph. For the three years that he stayed in Mendelssohn's home he became a pupil of Mendelssohn himself, who continued to take an interest in him in later years .\n\nUnder Emperor Joseph II the status of the Jews in Austria underwent a complete change when Jewish children were  obliged to attend regular German schools. But there were no teachers capable of organizing these schools and undertake the teaching, so Homberg decided to return to Austria. Armed with a recommendation from Mendelssohn, he was in 1784 appointed superintendent of all the German-Jewish schools of Galicia.\n\nIn 1793 Emperor Francis II called Homberg to Vienna to formulate laws to regulate the new status of the Jews in Austria. The work appeared in 1797, and won for Homberg a gold medal. When the general primary schools of Galicia were made subject to the district schools, Homberg retired to Vienna, employed partly as censor and partly to write text books for Jewish children in their new schools. Homberg was later appointed assistant professor of religious and moral philosophy at Prague, with the title of Schulrath, retaining this position until his death.\n", "He":

In 1600 he was head of the beth din in Dubno, from 1602 in Ostrog, (now in the Czech Republic) and from 1606 in Frankfurt on Main, Germany. After the Jews of Frankfurt were expelled in 1614, he became rabbi in Prague but after his wife died in 1621 moved to the Land of Israel where he was rabbi of the Ashkenazi community. In 1625, Horowitz was imprisoned by the pasha (Ottoman governor) and held to ransom. On his release, he became rabbi of Safed. He died in Tiberias and was buried near to Maimonides. He is best known for his compendium, Shenei Lukhot ha-Berit, both he and the book being generally known by its initials, \"Shelah\". It contained laws of the festivals and the 613 commandments. It soon became one of the classics of rabbinic study and influenced early Hasidic thought.

He attended the Evangelical gymnasium at Pest and concurrently studied at the Talmud school of O'buda. After his graduation he became a teacher at O'buda. He joined the army and took part in the revolution of 1848. After the defeat he escaped to Paks, Hungary, where he resumed his yeshiva studies. He served as rabbi at Miava, Moravia (now in the Czech Republic) from 1854 to 1857 but, feeling the need to advance his secular knowledge, then decided to do post-graduate studies at the University of Prague and was awarded a Ph.D. In 1861. Subsequently he was appointed rabbi at the Prague Neu-Synagogue.\n\nIn 1866 Huebsch was invited to move to New York, USA, to become rabbi of Congregation Ahawath Chesed in New York City, whose members were mainly Czech Jews. He remained with the congregation for the remainder of his life. Huebsch introduced a number of moderate reforms in the ritual and wrote a new prayer book, which was in time adopted by many other congregations. Huebsch also established a secondary school for some four hundred girls and boys, and a cultural association to enable young Jews to study and discuss Jewish literature.\n\nAs a scholar, Huebsch's main work was his edition of the \"Syrian Peshitto\" on the five Megillot: \"Hamesh Megillot im Targum Suri\" (1866), translated as \"Die Fuenf Megilloth nebst dem Syrischen Thargum\". He also published a collection of his sermons, \"Dein Licht und deine Wahrheit: Sieben Predigten\" (New York, 1868), and a book of Arabic aphorisms and sayings \"Gems of the Orient\" (1887). Huebsch contributed a number of tracts to \"Ben-Chananja\" and to the \"Monatschrift\".

After World War I, he went to Prague, Czech Republic, as a teacher of religion at secondary schools and the Talmud Torah. He attended the German university in Prague. In the city he reorganized the communal library and  wrote a small book in both German and Czech on its history. He conducted research into the history of the Jews in Bohemia and wrote many articles on the subject in the yearbook of the society for the history of Czechoslovakian Jewry and in \"Vstnik\", the journal of the Prague community. During the occupation of Bohemia (1939), he and Joseph Polak directed the Jewish museum, which was subsequently taken over by the Nazis in 1942. He organized a book exhibition in 1942 and wrote the major part of the museum guide.

{"En": "Jellinek, Adolf (Aaron) (1821-1893), scholar, Chief Rabbi of Vienna, born in Drslawitz, a village in Moravia, Austrian Empire (now in the Czech Republic). His ancestral background is believed to stem from Czech peasants (Hussite), who, in the eighteen\u2019s century, converted to Judaism out of religious conviction. His younger brother was Dr. Herman Jellinek, a revolutionary, who was executed after the 1848 Revolution. \n\nJellinek studied at the yeshiva of Menahem Katzin Prossnitz, and moved to Prague in 1838. There he continued his studies with major rabbis. He moved on to Leipzig, Germany, four years later where he studied philosophy and semitics. He graduated in 1845 and accepted the position of preacher at Leipzig\u2019s Berliner Synagogue. \n\nWhile in Leipzig, Jellinek devoted special attention to scientific research in religious philosophy, bibliography, Jewish mysticism, Kabbala and Midrash. In 1848 he founded, together with a Christian clergyman, the Kirchlicher Verein fuer alle Religionsbekenntnisse. This was an association open to all religious groups. The Saxon minister of religious affairs prevented him from representing his association at the Frankfurt German National Assembly (1848). In 1856 Jellinek was appointed preacher at the new Leopoldstadter Synagogue in Vienna, and nine years later, in 1865, after the death of Chief Rabbi Mannheimer, he was named Chief Rabbi of Vienna and served at the Seitenstetten Synagogue. \n\nJellinek was soon recognized as the most gifted preacher in modern Judaism, (about 200 of his sermons were published). He related to problems of the day, making use of Agada and Midrash, which distinguished him from his predecessors. He advocated a moderately liberal line and strove to have unity in the community. He helped to avoid a split in the Jewish community by providing a conciliatory attitude with the Orthodox rabbi Solomon Benjamin Spitzer. In 1861 he ran for a seat in the Diet of Lower Austria but did not succeed. Jellinek promoted the abolition of capital punishment for political offenses, being influenced by the executions of his brother and Emperor Maximilian of Mexico. He expressed his ideas in the \"Neuzeit\", a paper he edited from 1882. Jellinek was Baron M. Hirsch\u2019s trustee for philanthropic activities in Galicia. He opposed the rise of Zionism, and refused to back L. Pinsker\u2019s views. With the emerging of more antagonistic  anti-Semitism, he turned to apologetics of the Jewish religion and persuaded  Joseph Samuel Bloch to write his \"Israel und die Voelker\". \n\nJellinek was a prolific writer and published scholarly works in numerous fields, including Kabbalah, Zohar, Talmud and Midrash. Rabbi Dr. Adolf Jellinek died in Vienna in December 1893.    \n \n \n\n", "He": "\u05e8\u05d1, \u05d3\u05e8\u05e9\u05df, \u05d5\u05de\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05d3 1821 - 1893\n\n\u05e0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3

He continued his studies in Germany and earned a doctorate from the University of Leipzig. He first attracted attention when he delivered a lecture on the occasion of Leibnitz\u2019s 200th anniversary (1847) in which he opposed Leibnitz\u2018s philosophy.  \n\nJellinek was expelled from the university because of extremist activity. In reaction he wrote \"Das Denunciation System des saechsischen Liberalismus und des kritisch-nihilistische System Herman Jellineks\" (1847). He moved to Berlin, where together with Bruno Bauer he pursued his radical ideas. \n\nHaving been expelled from Berlin, he moved to Vienna in the year of the 1848 revolution. At the same time he contributed articles to \"Die Grenzboten\" of Kuranda. Jellinek was more radical than his editor, and left the periodical. He contributed his revolutionary anti Habsburg articles to the \"Allgemeine Oesterreichische Zeitung\" and to \"Der Radikale\". Those articles denote the influence of Karl Marx's ideas on the writer. After the failure of the revolution and the declaration of the martial law, Jellinek's friends begged him to leave the country, but he refused. He was subsequently arrested for his revolutionary activities and sentenced to death by a military tribunal along with his non-Jewish friend A.Becher. Jellinek was executed on November 23, 1848, but his friend not. It was suggested that Hermann Jellinek was executed because of his Jewishness, while A.Becher was a Protestant.\n\nHermann Jellinek's works include \"Die Taeuschung der aufgeklaerten Juden und ihre Fachigkeit zur Emancipation\" (1847), in which he mocks the attempt of Jews to describe Judaism as an enlightened religion in order to gain equal rights.\n ", "He": ""}, "UnitText2": {"En": null, "He": ""}, "UnitPlaces": [{"PlaceIds": "72071"}, {"PlaceIds": "72491"}, {"PlaceIds": "74123"}, {"PlaceIds": "74123"}, {"PlaceIds": "113788"}], "UnitStatus": 3, "LastName": {"He": "Jellinek"}, "PeriodDesc": {"En": "1822|1848|", "He": "1822|1848|"}, "PersonTypeCodes": "270|329|179|", "UnitHeaderDMSoundex": {"En": "ZZ E186500 E486500 ZZ E596600 ZZ ", "He": "ZZ H186500 ZZ H596600 ZZ "}, "PrevPictureFileNames": null, "RightsCode": 1, "PeriodTypeCode": "1|2|", "UnitId": 112904, "IsValueUnit": true, "StatusDesc": "Completed", "NickName": {"He": null}, "UserLexicon": "57220", "EditorRemarks": "Person - Persons", "Attachments": [], "DisplayStatusDesc": "Museum only", "PeriodEndDate": "18229999|18489999|", "PeriodNum": "1|2|", "UnitType": 8, "OtherNames": {"He": null}, "Header": {"En": "Jellinek, Hermann ", "He": "\u05d9\u05dc\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05e7, \u05d4\u05e8\u05de\u05df"}, "PeriodTypeDesc": {"En": "Date of birth|Date of death|", "He": "\u05dc\u05d9\u05d3\u05d4|\u05e4\u05d8\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4|"}, "PersonalityId": 112904, "ForPreview": false, "_id": "112904"}, {"PeriodDateTypeDesc": {"En": "Year|Year|", "He": "\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd|\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd|"}, "FirstName": {"He": null}, "Title": {"He": null}, "LocationInMuseum": "", "Pictures": [], "PictureUnitsIds": null, "related": ["familyname_kahane", "place_wroclaw-breslau", "place_mukachevo", "place_pohorelice"], "Expr2": null, "Expr1": null, "UpdateDate": "2012-03-06 08:05:00", "OldUnitId": null, "Bibiliography": {"En": "Bibl: Encyclopedia Judaica 10/682 \nMiriam Hejnal\nPeter Reich\nHaim Ghiuzeli", "He": null}, "PersonTypeCodesDesc": {"En": "\u05e8\u05d1|\u05de\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd|", "He": "Rabbi|Scholars|"}, "id": 333270, "UpdateUser": "haim", "UnitDisplayStatus": 2, "PersonTypeIds": "1|2|", "PrevPicturePaths": null, "TS": "\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0002pG", "FamilyNameIds": "87539|", "MiddleName": {"He": null}, "PictureSources": null, "UnitTypeDesc": "Personality", "PeriodStartDate": "19040000|19630000|", "Slug": {"En": "luminary_kahane-isaak-yitzhak-zeev", "He": "\u05d0\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea_\u05db\u05d0\u05d4\u05e0\u05d4-\u05d9\u05e6\u05d7\u05e7-\u05d9\u05e6\u05d7\u05e7-\u05d6\u05d0\u05d1"}, "PeriodDateTypeCode": "1|1|", "RightsDesc": "Full", "IsMainCreatorType": "1|0|", "UnitText1": {"En": "Kahane, Isaak (Yitzhak Ze'ev) (1904-1963), rabbinic scholar, born in Munkacs, Hungary (then part of Austria-Hungary, now Mukacevo in Ukraine).

One of five children of a rural tenant farmer, he attended the town\u2019s Jewish elementary school from 1856 to 1860. He then went to a local grammar school, but started to learn Jewish subjects under a private teacher. In 1867 he went to the yeshiva in Breslau (now Wroclaw, in Poland) in nearby Prussian Silesia and was ordained as a rabbi in 1877.   He also studied natural sciences, philosophy and oriental studies at Breslau University. At this time Kaufmann, an Austrian citizen, drafted a petition in the name of all the Austrian students at Breslau and sent it to the Imperial-Royal War Ministry in Vienna requesting the recognition of the qualification obtained at the Breslau yeshiva and its validity for the exemption from military service replacing it with a one-year voluntary service. The request was granted. In 1874 he received his doctorate from Leipzig University for a dissertation about Sa\u2018adyah Gaon\u2019s philosophy of religion.   \n\nIn 1877, Kaufmann was appointed professor of history, philosophy, and homiletics at the newly founded Budapest Rabbinical Seminary, where he taught until his death. He also taught Greek and German in the seminary\u2019s lower school and served as the seminary\u2019s librarian for 20 years. \n\nKaufmann was a prolific writer, publishing 30 books and more than 500 articles written in German and Hungarian in just 25 years. His scholarship covered nearly the entire range  of Jewish knowledge. Of his works on the philosophy of religion, the most important concerned the theology of Bahya ben Joseph Ibn Pakuda, published in 1884, and a survey of the Jewish and Arabic religious philosophy of the Middle Ages, published in 1877. Kaufmann wrote biographies of several important Jewish families from the Habsburg lands, including Samson Wertheimer and his children (1888), Rabbi Yair Chaim Bacharach (1894), Glueckel of Hamel (1896), and the Gompertz Family into which his wife had been born. He also wrote books on on the expulsion of Jews from Vienna in 1670, and on the Jews of Buda during the Turkish siege of 1686. In 1884 Kaufmannhe, together with Abraham Berliner (1833\u20131915), established \"Mekitse Nirdamim\", an association for publishing old Hebrew manuscripts. He also published the  \"Monatsschrift f\u00fcr Geschichte und Wissenschaft des Judentums\", which included many articles by him concerning Jewish philosophy, history and tradition.\n\nKaufmann wrote numerous articles on synagogue art and Hebrew illuminated manuscripts, making him a pioneer in the field of Jewish art history. He also wrote polemical works, defending Judaism against defamatory attacks by the German orientalist Paul de Lagarde, and the German antisemitic preacher Adolf Stoecker. Kaufmann\u2019s enthusiastic book-length review of George Eliot\u2019s \"Daniel Deronda\", which he published in German in 1877 (later translated into English), was full of the rhetoric of Jewish nationalism. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the Paris-based Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle and was a founding member of its Hungarian branch.\n\nHe also assembled a large collection of Hebrew manuscripts, including the oldest known complete copy of the Mishnah. Following his widow\u2019s death in 1905, the Kaufmann Collection\u2014consisting of 594 manuscripts and 1,092 printed books\u2014was donated to the Library of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Kaufmann used part of the wealth at his disposal when he married into the well endowed Gompertz family to support the activities of several Jewish scholars both in Hungary and in Poland and Russia. These scholars coined for him the abbreviated name RaDaK in accordance with an old Jewish custom.

Kestenberg joined the Social-Democratic movement, and began to work for his ideal, the social integration of musical life. From 1905, Kestenberg organized performances of folk choirs, concerts, and meetings at the \"Freie Folksbuehne\" (\"Popular Theater\").  After his appointment in 1918 as music adviser, and then in 1927 as the music counselor, at the Prussian Ministry of Culture, he brought about a reform of musical education known today as the \"Kestenberg Reform\". His yearly educational decrees extended to music teachers in academies, seminars, conservatories, schools, and kindergartens.   \n\nWhen in 1933 the Nazis came to power in Germany, Kestenberg fled to Prague, Czech Republic, where he founded the International Society for Music Education, under the sponsorship of the Czech Ministry of Education. In 1938 he moved to Palestine and became the general manager of \"The Palestine Symphony Orchestra\". In 1945 Kestenberg founded the Music Teachers' Training College in Tel Aviv, which he headed for over 15 years, considering it to be the fulfillment of his musical dream.  As professor at the Tel Aviv Academy of Music, he taught a number of well-known Israel pianists.

In 1927 he moved to Prague, where he opened an attorney\u2019s office. Kohn was a personal friend of Tomas Masaryk who was to become the first president of Czechoslovakia and was a joint founder of the Masaryk's Realist Party and then a member of the latter\u2019s Sociological Society. Kohn was also the chairman of the Czech section of the Pan Europe Union, a pacifist organization which promoted the idea of creating a United States of Europe. He was involved in Jewish life in the country  and in 1907 helped to found the Union of Progressive Czech Jews which criticized the older generation of Jews for aligning themselves with Czech politicians who had supported antisemitism. He did not believe in total assimilation of Czech Jewry, as did the many of the country's Jewish community, but developed a philosophy of a permanent process of progressive adaptation to changing conditions within which the separate identity of the Jewish would gradually disappear.  \nKohn was among the few Czech integrationists who did not oppose Zionism. He saw it as a possible alternative to the integration of Jews into the Czech nation if integration, which he preferred, was not acceptable to either Czechs and Jews. He did not consider the process of assimilation to be a one-sided phenomenon but rather a process of adaptation that could enrich both sides of the population\u2014the minority as well as the majority. The idea of assimilation as a constantly occurring human adaptation became a leading topic in his philosophical texts, one he explored far beyond pragmatic discussions of Czech Jews and Zionists. He hoped that all peoples would gradually lose their prejudices. Kohn's writings were published in many Czech magazines and newspapers. He was editor of the Smer magazine in Pilsen.", "He": "1874 \u2013 1935\n\u05e4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5\u05e1\u05d5\u05e3\n\n\u05e0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3 \u05d1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05d1\u05e8\u05dd,

Returning to Prague, he continued his observant lifestyle, including the hasidic garb. When World War I broke out Langer returned to Belz but was conscripted into the Austrian army; he was released because of his religious stringency. He then taught at a Jewish school  and published Hebrew poetry.  He also wrote books in German applying psychoanalysis to aspects of Jewish literature.

Many of his works involved the Holocaust. According to Charfles Larson, professor of literature at the American University of Washington, DC, Lustig was \u201cthe greatest novelist of the Holocaust\u201d.\n\nAs a 15 year-old Jewish boy, Lustig was sent to Theresienstadt Nazi concentration camp and was subsequently transported to Auschwitz and Buchenwald Nazi concentration camps. In 1945 the Nazis loaded him on a train which was due to take him to Dachau concentration camp, but he succeeded in escaping after the locomotive was bombed by an American aircraft. He then returned to Prague by foot to join the resistance movement. He participated in the May 1945 anti-Nazi uprising in Prague. Most other members of his family had been murdered by the Nazis although his mother and sister survived. \n  \nAfter WW 2, Lustig studied journalism in Prague University and then worked for Radio Prague as a reporter and magazine editor. While in Israel, when reporting on the Israel War of Independence, he met poetry writer Vera Weislitzova, who was a volunteer for the Haganah and whom he later married. Vera, who had also been held in Theresientstadt, was the daughter of a furniture maker from Ostrava, Czech Republic. Both of her parents were murdered in Auschwitz. \nHe left the Czech Communist Party in protest against his government\u2019s breaking off relations with Israel after the 1967 Six Day War. In the summer of 1968 he was in Italy advocating the reformist view of Czech leader Alexander Dubcek when he heard that the Russians had invaded Czechoslovakia. Instead of returning home he went first to Israel, then to Yugoslavia and finally to the USA, where he accepted positions at the University of Iowa and then at the American University. After the fall of communism in 1989 he continued to teach at the American University, but lived partly in Washington DC and partly in Prague. Only in 2003 did he again become a permanent resident of Prague.\n  \nIn 2006 he was honoured by Vaclav Havel, past President of the Czech Republic, for his contribution to Czech culture and in 2008 he was awarded the Franz Kafka Prize.\n      \nSome of his stories were published in the USA under the title \u201cChildren of the Holocaust\u201d. One short story concerns with two young people running away from a train and hiding in the woods where they stole bread from a farm. They were almost executed for their crime. Probably Lustig\u2019s best known book was \"A Prayer for Katerina Horowitzowa\" (1974), which tells of a group of Jewish American businessmen trapped in Nazi Germany who tried to bribe their way out of the country. The Nazis kept tricking them and they were finally murdered in the concentration camps. Among his other 20 works were   \"Dita Saxova\" (1962), \"Night and Hope\" (1957), \"Art from the Ashes\" (1995) and \"Lovely Green Eyes\" (2004). \"Dita Saxona\" and \"Night and Hope\" were made into films.   \n      ", "He": "1926 \u2013 2011\n\u05e0\u05d9\u05e6\u05d5\u05dc \u05e9\u05d5\u05d0\u05d4, \u05e1\u05d5\u05e4\u05e8, \u05de\u05d7\u05d6\u05d0\u05d9\n\u05e0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3

He received his Jewish education from his father which was later a major factor in his ethical and legal thinking and writing.\n\nOffner developed an interest in politics while practicing law and was elected member of the House of Representatives (1901). There he worked with others for changes (three additions) in the civil code (1914-1916). Offner was active with Emil Steinbach in making fundamental changes in legislation and judicial practice, during the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century.\n\nOffner was also active in introducing many social and economic new bills in the Austrian Parliament. His work in developing legislation, prompted his colleagues to refer to Offner as the \u201cConscience of the Parliament\u201d. Among  the laws he initiated one was called after his name \u201cLex Offner\u201d (1914). This law dealt with the amounts on which was based the classification of crimes against property. Offner attempted to abolish the old marriage law, which gave advantage to the Catholic majority. His Jewish origin brought him enemies both from the Jews who were afraid of anti-Semitism, and from non-Jews who accused him of intervention in religious matters.\n\nOffner was unsuccessful in the election of 1919, and was replaced by another Jew and Zionist candidate, Robert Sticker.

He composed BALLADE FOR A SAILOR to the words of the Czech poet Iaczi Wolker and it was performed by the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra.\nIn 1936 he came to Eretz Israel and soon became one of the prominent figures in its musical life. He played the harpsichord all over the country, performing with the Philharmonic Orchestra, the Radio Orchestra, the Tel Aviv Symphony Orchestra and others. He toured abroad with various orchestras and lectured on the music of Bach in Europe and the United States with great success.\nIn 1951 he moved to Haifa. Until his untimely death he was the music director of the Haifa Symphony Orchestra and the Haifa Theater. From 1950-1953 he was director of music education in the Ministry of Education and Culture. During his term of office he founded the Music Library in Tel Aviv and the Recording Archives for Jewish and Oriental Music.

Later he left for Vienna, Austria, where he did different simple works. \n\nJosef Popper, invented a device which was very important in the engine industry (1868). He could live on the profits he earned from his inventions, and dedicated his life to writing on social reform. He took the pseudonim of Lynkeus, (a mythological figure). As an inventor, he was far ahead of his time and invented objects and systems to be used years later. \n\nHis bigger fame was, however, as a writer on social reform. He defended the right of people to live in freedom and dignity without being exploited by the state. He believed that social problems can be solved when every member in the society will contribute to the total welfare of society. His ideas are incorporated in the policy of the modern welfare state. Popper suffered a lot from his being a Jew, but refused to convert. He accused Otto Bismarck of anti-Semitism and came to the conclusion that only a Jewish State could eliminate anti-Semitism. But even with those Zionist thoughts, he did not take an active part in the Zionist movement.\n\nPopper was a very close friend of Albert Einstein, and was regarded as a genius. He donated a great part of his books to the Jewish National Library in Jerusalem. His bust, which was erected in the Rathauspark in Vienna, was destroyed by the Nazis in 1938.           \n \n ", "He": "1838 \u2013 1921\n\u05e4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5\u05e1\u05d5\u05e3

He settled in Prague, made concert tours to France, England and Russia, and taught piano. After serving in the army during World War\u00a0I, he went back to Prague and resumed teaching. From 1935 till 1938 he worked for the Czech Radio. In 1933 he received Soviet citizenship.\rIn his music, Schulhoff dealt with modern dance forms and quarter tone experiments. The cantata MANIFEST for choir and orchestra (1932) marks a new direction in his composition. Schulhoff composed works for piano as well as operas, ballet music, symphonies and string quartets.

He studied in Nikolsburg (Mikulov) and Pressburg (Pozsony, now Bratislava, Slovakia) under Mordecai b. Abraham Naphtali Banet and Moses Sofer respectively. \n\nHaving served first as rabbi of Gewitsch and of Prossnitz (Prostejov, Czech Republic), Schwab was invited to become chief rabbi of Pest in 1836. An outstanding Talmudist and orator, he also succeeded in creating an atmosphere of tolerance and conciliation in his congregation. The term of his rabbinate coincided with increasing Magyarization among Hungarian Jewry, which culminated in the struggle for full emancipation. Schwab encouraged the members of his community to cultivate the use of the Hungarian language, and to engage in agriculture and other productive labor; he was one of the founders of the Society for the Promotion of Handicrafts and Agriculture among Hungarian Jews (MIKEFE). Schwab was also interested in mathematics and philosophy. He was among the founders of the Jewish hospital and the Dohany Street Synagogue in Budapest.\n\n In 1844 he submitted a proposal to publish the main tenets and principles of the Jewish religion, in order to prove their compatibility with the requirements of a modern state, to refute slanders by the opponents of Jewish civil rights, and to allay their suspicions. His proposal was rejected by the rabbinic council of Paks (1844), but in 1846 his own congregation of Pest entrusted him with preparing this publication. It was printed in both Hungarian and German as a compendium of religious instruction for secondary school graduates and went into seven editions.\n\nDuring the 1848 revolution Schwab voiced his opinions on both religious and secular political matters. Although admitting the need for some moderate and cautious innovations in the religious sphere, Schwab strongly opposed the extreme reformist program of the congregation led by Ignaz Einhorn. He supported, however, the Hungarian national liberation movement, including the declaration of independence from Habsburg rule (1849). After the  suppression of the revolutionary struggle, Schwab was arrested and kept in prison, with his son-in-law, Leopold Loew, for two weeks.\n\nSchwab's published works include religious poems in Hebrew and German, and some sermons. Schwab's archive is kept at the National Library of Israel.

Born in Amstivov near Vilkaviskis, Lithuania, Shabbtai studied under Joshua Hoeschel ben Joseph both in Tykocin (north eastern Poland) and then in the Yeshivah of Krakow. In Lublin he studied under Naphtali Ben Isaac ha-Kohen. Settling in Vilna, he married the daughter of Samson Wolf, a grandson of Moses Isserles. His father-in-law provided his material needs, which enabled him to devote himself wholly to study. He was appointed dayan of the Bet Din of Moses Lima in Vilna. \n\nShabbtai published his first work Siftei Kohen, a commentary on the Shulchan Aruch Yoreh De'ah in Krakow in 1646. The work received high praise from leading Polish and Lithuanian scholars and since 1674 has been published as an integral part of most editions of the Yoreh De'ah. In this work Shabbtai attempts to explain and clarify Joseph Caro\u2019s rulings in the Shulchan Aruch and to rule on the criticisms of Moses Isserles. A lengthy dispute ensured with Rabbi David Ben Samuel ha-Levi, another renowned posek, who proceeded to publish Turei Zahav, his own commentary on the Yoreh De'ah. Shabbtai and Ha-Levi wrote several rebuttals and counter-rebuttals of one another\u2019s views. The halachic dispute between the two was continued after their deaths by other scholars. In most cases the rabbis of Poland and Lithuania ruled in accordance with Shabbtai, while those of Germany accepted the view of  David ha-Levi. In contrast to previous generations of Polish scholars Shabbtai gave his full support to Joseph Caro\u2019s rulings in the Shulchan Aruch.\n\nShabbtai also wrote a commentary on the Hoshen Mishpat, published after his death together with the text of the Shulhan Arukh (Amsterdam, 1663). In this work he explains, but also offers some criticisms, of the rulings of Caro. Shabbtai's conclusions were based not only upon Talmudic principles and rulings of other poskim but also upon straight logic. His work is a classic of its kind and still today it is considered to be an authoritative reference work for halachic authorities.\n\nDuring the anti-Jewish violence in 1655, Shabbtai fled from Vilna to Lublin. Three month later the rioters reached Lublin and Shabbtai escaped to Bohemia. He stayed first in Prague, and then for a time in Dresnitz, Moravia, after which he was appointed rabbi of Holesov, where he died.  In an important historical work Meggilat Eifah Shabbtai described the Ukrainian rebellions against the Poles which to a large measure were directed against the Jews. The year 1635 saw the first big explosion of violence in Ukraine but this attempt at the revolution was crushed. It returned with new vigor thirteen years later. This second rebellion, in 1648-9, succeeded in freeing a large part of the Ukraine from Polish rule.  In the course of the violence Ukrainian leader, Bogdan Chmielnicki, one of the greatest anti-Semites in history, organized the murder of an estimated 100,000 Jews in the most horrendous ways.   \n\nShabbtai  also composed Selichot (Amsterdam, 1651). His other works are: He-Arukh (Berlin, 1767), a commentary on the Arba'ah Turim (a forerunner of the Shulchan Aruch  written by  Jacob ben Asher),  Tokfo Kohen (Frankfort/Oder, 1677), on the laws of possession; Gevurat Anashim (Dessau, 1697), on chapter 154 of the Shulchan Aruch;  and Po'el Zedek (Jesenice, 1720), on the 613 commandments as enumerated by Maimonides.", "He":

He was brought up in Vienna, a child prodigy at the piano. He began to tour Europe with phenomenal success when he was only ten years old. After an extended period of study he abandoned the piano for the baton. In 1917 he became conductor of the State Theatre in Strasbourg, France, and two years later he made his first appearance at the German Theatre in Prague, Czech Republic (then Czechoslovakia). After numerous engagements in important opera houses in Budapest and Germany, he became first conductor at the Berlin State Opera (1924), retaining this post for five years. In 1929 he was appointed first conductor of the National Theatre in Prague. When he resigned from this post in 1936 Szell succeeded John Barbirolli as conductor of the Glasgow Symphony Orchestra. He also appeared as guest conductor throughout Europe and Australia.\n\nIn 1940 Szell went to the United States, making his American debut at the Hollywood Bowl. In New York City he conducted the National Broadcasting Company Symphony Orchestra (1941) and the orchestra of the New Friends of Music (1941-42). In 1942 he was appointed guest conductor of the Metropolitan Opera House, New York. He was also a teacher at the Institute of Musical Art. In 1946 Szell went to Cleveland, where he stayed until his death.

In 1939 he went to the United States, settled in New York City and started using American folk-music material in his works as in UNDER THE SPREADING CHESTNUT TREE (1939), THE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW for orchestra (1940) and THE LINCOLN SYMPHONY (1941). Weinberger also composed the operas OUTCASTS OF POKER FLAT (1932; based on the story by Bret Harte) and WALLENSTEIN (1937), and the ballet SARATOGA (1941). Depressed by his inability to be part of the American music scene he committed suicide in St. Petersburg, Florida (USA). His manuscripts are preserved at the National and University Library in Jerusalem.", "He": "\u05de\u05dc\u05d7\u05d9\u05df. \u05e0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3 \u05d1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d0\u05d2, \u05e6'\u05db\u05d5\u05e1\u05dc\u05d5\u05d1\u05e7\u05d9\u05d4. \u05dc\u05de\u05d3 \u05d1\u05e7\u05d5\u05e0\u05e1\u05e8\u05d1\u05d8\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d0\u05d2 \u05d5\u05d1\u05dc\u05d9\u05d9\u05e4\u05e6\u05d9\u05d2 (\u05d1\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05d9\u05ea\u05e8, \u05d0\u05e6\u05dc \u05e8\u05d2\u05e8). \u05d4\u05d0\u05d5\u05e4\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e7\u05d5\u05de\u05d9\u05ea \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5 \u05e9\u05d5\u05d5\u05d0\u05e0\u05d3\u05d4 \u05e0\u05d2\u05df \u05d7\u05de\u05ea \u05d4\u05d7\u05dc\u05d9\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd, \u05e9\u05d4\u05d5\u05e2\u05dc\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d0\u05d2 \u05d1-1927, \u05d6\u05d9\u05db\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e4\u05e8\u05e1\u05d5\u05dd \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05de\u05d9. \u05d4\u05d0\u05d5\u05e4\u05e8\u05d4 \u05e9\u05d9\u05dc\u05d1\u05d4 \u05e0\u05e2\u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05ea \u05de\u05ea\u05d5\u05da \u05d4\u05e4\u05d5\u05dc\u05e7\u05dc\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d4\u05e6'\u05db\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d4\u05e1\u05dc\u05d5\u05d1\u05e7\u05d9. \u05d4\u05e4\u05d5\u05dc\u05e7\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d4\u05e4\u05d5\u05d2\u05d4 \u05de\u05ea\u05d5\u05da \u05d0\u05d5\u05e4\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d6\u05d5 \u05de\u05d1\u05d5\u05e6\u05e2\u05d5\u05ea \u05dc\u05e2\u05ea\u05d9\u05dd \u05e7\u05e8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05d1\u05e7\u05d5\u05e0\u05e6\u05e8\u05d8\u05d9\u05dd. \u05db\u05de\u05d5 \u05db\u05df, \u05db\u05ea\u05d1 \u05e9\u05d9\u05e8 \u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9 (1936). \u05d1-1939 \u05d4\u05d2\u05d9\u05e2 \u05dc\u05d0\u05e8\u05d4\"\u05d1, \u05d4\u05ea\u05d9\u05d9\u05e9\u05d1 \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05d5-\u05d9\u05d5\u05e8\u05e7 \u05d5\u05d4\u05ea\u05d7\u05d9\u05dc \u05dc\u05d4\u05e9\u05ea\u05de\u05e9 \u05d1\u05d7\u05d5\u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05de\u05df \u05d4\u05de\u05d5\u05e1\u05d9\u05e7\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e2\u05de\u05de\u05d9\u05ea \u05d4\u05d0\u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05e7\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea (\u05db\u05da, \u05dc\u05de\u05e9\u05dc, \u05d1\u05ea\u05d7\u05ea \u05e6\u05de\u05e8\u05ea\u05d5 \u05d4\u05de\u05ea\u05e4\u05e9\u05d8\u05ea \u05e9\u05dc \u05e2\u05e5 \u05d4\u05e2\u05e8\u05de\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd, 1939, \u05d1\u05d0\u05d2\u05d3\u05ea Sleepy\u00a0Hollow \u05dc\u05ea\u05d6\u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05ea, 1940, \u05d5\u05d1\u05e1\u05d9\u05de\u05e4\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05ea \u05dc\u05d9\u05e0\u05e7\u05d5\u05dc\u05df, 1941). \u05d5\u05d9\u05d9\u05e0\u05d1\u05e8\u05d2\u05e8 \u05d7\u05d9\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d2\u05dd \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05d0\u05d5\u05e4\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea Outcasts\u00a0of\u00a0Poker\u00a0Flat (1932;

Prague city had a strong Jewish community which was culturally German. His father, attorney Theodore Weltsch, was active in local Jewish public affairs and at the turn of the century served as director general of the \"Centralverein zur Pflege J\u00fcdischer Angelegenheiten\" (\"Central Society for Handling Jewish Affairs\"), founded in Prague in 1885.\n\nIn 1910, Weltsch graduated from the German gymnasium of the Alt-Stadt in Prague, and went on to study law at the Karl-Ferdinand German University of Prague. He was a member of  the Zionist student association Bar Kochba, and between 1910 and 1914 he published articles in German-language Zionist newspapers including the Prague-based weekly \"Selbstwehr\" as well as in \"Die Welt\". During World War I he served as an officer of the Austrian army on the Russian front.  During this period he continued to write articles for the German-language Zionist press.\n\nWhile wishing to see a large Jewish community living in Palestine, he strongly favoured a future bi-national state in which both Jews and Arabs would live side by side.  Weltsch\u2019s reservations about the establishment of a Jewish nation-state in Palestine constituted just one component of his critical attitude toward the very principle of self-determination of national groups within multiethnic territories. He regarded the actual implementation of this principle in East Central Europe after World War I as a fateful mistake, whose origin he traced to the \u201cunnatural,\u201d external intervention of the United States. \n\nShortly after WW I, Zionist leaders in Germany invited Weltsch to Berlin to serve as editor in chief of \"J\u00fcdische Rundschau\", the official journal of the Zionist Federation of Germany and one of the most widely read interwar publications in the Jewish world. It appeared twice per week andt its peak the magazine had a regular readership of over 35,000. Because of his consistent adherence to the binational cause and his critical approach toward the policies of the mainstream Zionist movement, Weltsch often faced attempts to depose him as the editor of \"Juedische Rundschau\". Nevertheless, he held this post until 1938, when the Nazis forced the newspaper to cease publication. \n\nFrom 1925 to 1933 Weltsch was active in the Zionist \"Brit Shalom\" movement which advocated the binational solution for Palestine in which he believed. His newspaper's reaction to Hitler's rise to power was an article of 1933 in which it was written that \u201cwe understand the psychological and intellectual basis\u201d of the Nazi policies and respect their goal of national renewal.  \u201cThis, after all what the Zionists want for the Jews.   We believe that a nationally conscious Jewry could find its way to a modus vivendi with an inwardly strengthened Geman nationalism freed from the dross of crude anti-Semitism.\u201d \nWeltsch's most famous article was published immediately after the Nazis had organized a boycott of all Jewish-owned shops in 1934. In the article Weltsch wrote \"Wear it with pride, the yellow badge\u201d. It was a call for strength, solidarity and unity amongst the Jews amongst German Jews who until then had been very fragmented and made every effort to assimilate into German life. (His phrase was not a reference to the wearing of the yellow armband which Jews were obliged to wear from 1941). Wetsch had passionately agreed with the comment of the editor of the Vossische Zeitung who a short time earlier had written \u201c...from a higher standpoint anti-Semitic oppression has perhaps turned out to be a boon, in that a far greater number of German Jews than ever before are becoming more mindful of their traditions and their great past.\u201d\n\nIn 1935 the \"Juedische Rundschau\" was temporarily closed after Weltsch asserted that \u201cThe Jew is a human being also\u201d after a Goebbels' speech labelling Jews subhuman \u201cflees\u201d.\nAfter fleeing to Palestine in 1938, he continued agitating for accommodation with the Arab population of Mandate Palestine. Weltsch had wished to recommence publication of the \"Juedische Rundschau\" in Palestine, but he encountered vigorous opposition from the Hebrew newspaper establishment on account of his controversial views.\nWeltsch worked for \"Haaretz\" and in 1945 he moved to London, England, to become the newspaper's correspondent  there. In this capacity he covered the Nuremberg Trials. He was a major force in establishing the Leo Baeck Institute in London, which is dedicated to preserving German-Jewish culture and is named after the rabbi and leader of the German-Jewish community during the Nazi years. Weltsch edited the Institute's Yearbook from 1956 to 1978. From that time until his return to Jerusalem in 1978, he made a substantial contribution to the newspaper as a political journalist, a political analyst and book reviewer.", "He": "1891 \u2013

After the release of Fritz, the couple fled to England where they lived for a short time before immigrating to the USA settling in Fall River, MA, and then in Los Angeles. Most of their family and friends were murdered by the Nazis.\n\nMaria was the niece of Czech businessman and art collector Ferdinand Bloch whose collection included several paintings by Gustav Klimt. When Bloch died in 1946 he left his collection to a nephew and two nieces, one of whom was Maria Altmann. During the Nazi period Bloch\u2019s property had been looted and at the end of war some of the paintings were found to be held by the Austrian government. In the 1980s  Altmann attempted to negotiate the return of the Klimt landscape paintings to her family while she was prepared to allow Austria to keep the portraits. The Austrians claimed that Bloch\u2019s wife, who had died in 1925, had willed the paintings to the national gallery in Vienna. But it seems that they had no real evidence to support their claim. The Austrians made no attempt to negotiate the matter seriously so in 1999 Altmann sued the Austrian government. She dropped the case when the Austrian courts demanded a $350,000 filing fee. She then filed a lawsuit in California which ended up in the USA Supreme Court and which ruled in 2004 that the Austrian government was not immune from such a lawsuit. This time the Austrians agreed to arbitrate the matter seriously. In 2006 the arbitration court ruled that the Austrians should return the paintings and this was finally done. They were put on display at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. When the paintings were ultimately sold they were auctioned for some $416 million. It was the largest single return of Nazi looted art in Austria. \n \nMaria Altmann\u2019s story has been the subject of three documentary films.\n", "He": ""}, "UnitText2": {"En": "", "He": ""}, "UnitPlaces": [{"PlaceIds": "71957"}, {"PlaceIds": "71957"}, {"PlaceIds": "72322"}, {"PlaceIds": "74123"}, {"PlaceIds": "74123"}], "UnitStatus": 3, "LastName": {"He": null}, "PeriodDesc": {"En": "1918|2011|", "He": "1918|2011|"}, "PersonTypeCodes": null, "UnitHeaderDMSoundex": {"En": "ZZ E083660 ZZ E690000 ZZ ", "He": "ZZ H083660 ZZ H690000 ZZ "}, "PrevPictureFileNames": null, "RightsCode": 1, "PeriodTypeCode": "1|2|", "UnitId": 146639, "IsValueUnit": true, "StatusDesc": "Completed", "NickName": {"He": null}, "UserLexicon": null, "EditorRemarks": "", "Attachments": [], "DisplayStatusDesc": "Museum only", "PeriodEndDate": "19189999|20119999|", "PeriodNum": "0|1|", "UnitType": 8, "OtherNames": {"He": null}, "Header": {"En": "Altmann, Maria", "He": "\u05d0\u05dc\u05d8\u05de\u05df, \u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4"}, "PeriodTypeDesc": {"En": "Date of birth|Date of death|", "He": "\u05dc\u05d9\u05d3\u05d4|\u05e4\u05d8\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4|"}, "PersonalityId": 146639, "ForPreview": false, "_id": "146639"}, {"PeriodDateTypeDesc": {"En": "Year|Year|", "He": "\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd|\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd|"}, "FirstName": {"He": null}, "Title": {"He": null}, "LocationInMuseum": "", "Pictures": [{"PictureUrl": "https://storage.googleapis.com/bhs-flat-pics/3DA21D0F-5152-438E-91FE-543C136B1EE4.jpg", "PictureId": "3DA21D0F-5152-438E-91FE-543C136B1EE4", "IsPreview": "1"}], "PictureUnitsIds": "19481|", "related": ["image_hassidim-visiting-the-tomb-of-rabbi-aszod-dunajska-streda-czechoslovakia-1984", "familyname_aszod", "place_aszod-72650", "place_dunajska-streda"], "Expr2": null, "Expr1": null, "UpdateDate": "2012-07-19 10:22:00", "OldUnitId": null, "Bibiliography": {"En": "Encyclopedia Judaica 3/811\nZsido Lexikon p' 66 \nMiriam Hejnal\nPeter RFeich\nHaim Ghiuzeli", "He": null}, "PersonTypeCodesDesc": {"En": "\u05e8\u05d1|", "He": "Rabbi|"}, "id": 314347, "UpdateUser": "Zippi", "UnitDisplayStatus": 2, "PersonTypeIds": "1|", "PrevPicturePaths": ",Photos\\00001023.scn\\01916900.JPG|", "TS": "000000000002399b", "FamilyNameIds": "90428|", "MiddleName": {"He": null}, "PictureSources": null, "UnitTypeDesc": "Personality", "PeriodStartDate": "17940000|18660000|", "Slug": {"En": "luminary_aszod-judah-ben-israel", "He": "\u05d0\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea_\u05d0\u05e1\u05d5\u05d3-\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4-\u05d1\u05df-\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc"}, "PeriodDateTypeCode": "1|1|", "RightsDesc": "Full", "IsMainCreatorType": "1|", "UnitText1": {"En": "Aszod, Judah Ben Israel (1794-1866), rabbi, born in Aszod (Pest region), Hungary (then part of the Austrian Empire).

He resigned from this position in 1920 when he was appointed rabbi of the \"Etz Haim\" orthodox congregation in Strasbourg.  He held the position for twenty years during which time he organized a intensive and well regarded Talmud Torah directed by Salomon Speier, a pupil of Rabbi Salomon Breuer and in 1926, established a branch of the Yechouroun youth movement which had originally been founded by Samson Raphael Hirsch in Germany. \n\nYechouroun's members included many future leaders of the French Orthodox Jewish community including Samy Klein, Aron Wolf, Th\u00e9o Klein (1913-2007), Antoinette Feuerwerker, Rose Warfman, Salomon Gluck, Josy Eisenberg, Benjamin Gross, Jacquot Grunewald, Henri Ackermann, Liliane Ackermann, Andr\u00e9 Neher, Gilles Bernheim andRen\u00e9 Gutman.   \n\nFrom 1932 Brunschwig began to send students to the recently founded Yeshiva of Montreux in Switzerland. He was a member of the Agudat Yisrael movement and participated in its third assembly held in Marienbad, now in the Czech Republic, in 1937.\n  \nAfter the armistice in 1940, Rabbi Brunschwig again took up the duties of army chaplain in Vichy France. He went to Lyons where he became rabbi of a small congregation and  took care of the needs of the city's Orthodox community and in particular of those who had fled from Paris and the north of France and were now living in many parts of the town. He became an active member of the Resistance movement and was frequently in danger of being arrested. In an effort to protect him, he was given a forged certificate of citizenship of the state of San Salvador. Nevertheless he, together with his wife, were arrested in May 1944.

He studied at the University of Prague (now in the Czech Republic), and although he prepared for a rabbinical career, he did not pursue the idea on account of his liberal views. After a short period as a teacher he became in 1875 secretary of the Viennese Israelitische Alliance which did benevolent work amongst beleaguered Jewish communities. The work required visits to Galicia where, in cooperation with the Alliance Israelite Universelle, his organization aided exiled Russian Jews to migrate to the United States.\n\nFriedlander's experience of the conditions under which the Jews were living in Galicia prompted him to agitate for and to establish, the first Jewish public school in the province. A record of his journeys was published in Fuenf Wochen in Brody. Baron Maurice de Hirsch, whose endowment funds were partially devoted to the establishment of educational institutions for Jewish children in Galicia, found in Friedlander an articulate spokesman for his ideas and appointed him secretary of the Baron de Hirsch Fund. Under his supervision more than fifty such schools were founded in Galicia by the Hirsch Fund in the years 1885-1900. Due to his efforts a further fund, in the name of Baroness Clara de Hirsch, of some five million francs was set up for the establishment of technical schools for Jewish girls. \n\nFriedlander was an expert on Hellenistic philosophy and the origins of Christianity. He published a number of books on this subject including \"Ueber den Einfluss der Griechischen Philosophie auf das Judentum und Christentum\" (1872); \"Patristische und Talmudische Studien\" (1878); \"Apion: ein Culturbild aus dem ersten christlichen Jahrhundert\" (1882); \"Philo's Philantropie des juedischen Gesetzes\" - translation and commentary (1889); \"Zur Entstehunggeschichte des Christentums\" (1894); \"Das Judenthum in der vorchristlichen griechischen Welt\" (1897); \"Der vorchristliche Juedische Gnosticismus\" (1898); \"Der Antichrist\" (1902); \"Geschichte der juedischen Apologetik\" (1903); \"Die Religioese Bewegung innerhalb des Judenthums im Zeitalter Jesu\" (1906); \"Der Kreuzestod Jesu\" (1906), and \"Synagoge und Kirche\" (1908). He also published several books on his experiences in Galicia under the name of Marek Firkowitz. Friedlander also  used the pseudonyms of: M. Freimann and Paul Frieda.\n\nMoritz Frielander contributed to the Revue des Etudes Juives and to the Jewish Quarterly Review.

After graduating from Oxford University, Gollancz was commissioned into the Northumberland Fusiliers in October 1915, although he did not see active service. In 1917 he became involved in the Reconstruction Committee, an organisation that made plans for post-World War I Britain.\n\nHe was hired to work in a publishing business. Starting with magazines, Gollancz then brought out a series of art books, after which he started recruiting novelists. Gollancz formed his own publishing company in 1927, publishing works by writers such as George Orwell. Gollancz was one of the founders of the Left Book Club whose aim was to stop Nazism and prevent the outbreak of war. When he published \"The Red Army Moves\" by Geoffrey Cox on the Winter War in 1941, he omitted criticisms of the USSR. \n\nIn addition to his successful publishing business, Gollancz was a prolific writer on a variety of subjects. His 1943 pamphlet \"Let My People Go\", which called for the Allied powers to rescue Jews under threat of extermination in occupied Europe, reached a mass audience in 1943, following widespread coverage in the British media in December 1942 of the Nazi's extermination policy. A subsequent pamphlet on the same subject, published by Gollancz two years later, did not succeed. By then the British media had almost entirely ceased writing of the Nazi attempt to exterminate European Jewry, after it had become clear that the western powers were unwilling to rescue Jews in occupied Europe on the grounds that it would divert precious resources from the war effort. \n\nFrom 1945 he opposed Britain's pro-Arab policy in Palestine, but then proceeded to head an organization devoted to relief work for the Arabs during Israel's War of Independence. He advocated reconciliation between Jews and Germans and between Arabs and Jews. From 1952 to 1964 he was a member of the board of governors of the Hebrew University.   \n\nIn 1945 Gollancz turned his attention to crimes against the defeated Germans. He started a campaign for the humane treatment of German civilians and organised an airlift to provide Germany and other war torn European countries with  books, food and clothing from a Britain still subject to rationing. In his book, \"Our Threatened Values\" (London, 1946), Gollancz described the conditions Sudeten German prisoners faced in a Czech prison camp. In Britain he also worked on a campaign to abolish capital punishment in the 1950s. In February 1951 Victor Gollancz wrote a letter to \"The Guardian\" asking people to join an international struggle against poverty. This directly led to the founding of the international anti-poverty charity \"War on Want\". In 1960, he received the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade, being the first British person to receive this award. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1965.\n\nIn 1961 he wrote a book expressing his opposition to the Trial of Adolf Eichmann.", "He": ""}, "UnitText2": {"En": "", "He": ""}, "UnitPlaces": [{"PlaceIds": "66637"}, {"PlaceIds": "70980"}, {"PlaceIds": "71948"}, {"PlaceIds": "71948"}], "UnitStatus": 3, "LastName": {"He": null}, "PeriodDesc": {"En": "1893|1967|", "He": "1893|1967|"}, "PersonTypeCodes": null, "UnitHeaderDMSoundex": {"En": "ZZ E586400 ZZ E753900 E743900 ZZ ", "He": "ZZ H578640 H586400 ZZ H753790 H753900 ZZ "}, "PrevPictureFileNames": null, "RightsCode": 1, "PeriodTypeCode": "1|2|", "UnitId": 148870, "IsValueUnit": true, "StatusDesc": "Completed", "NickName": {"He": null}, "UserLexicon": null, "EditorRemarks": "", "Attachments": [], "DisplayStatusDesc": "Museum only", "PeriodEndDate": "18939999|19679999|", "PeriodNum": "0|1|", "UnitType": 8, "OtherNames": {"He": null}, "Header": {"En": "Gollancz, Victor", "He": "\u05d2\u05d5\u05dc\u05e0\u05e5', \u05d5\u05d9\u05e7\u05d8\u05d5\u05e8"}, "PeriodTypeDesc": {"En": "Date of birth|Date of death|", "He": "\u05dc\u05d9\u05d3\u05d4|\u05e4\u05d8\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4|"}, "PersonalityId": 148870, "ForPreview": false, "_id": "148870"}, {"PeriodDateTypeDesc": {"En": "Year|Year|", "He": "\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd|\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd|"}, "FirstName": {"He": null}, "Title": {"He": null}, "LocationInMuseum": "", "Pictures": [], "PictureUnitsIds": null, "related": ["place_paris", "place_budapest", "place_budapest", "place_berlin"], "Expr2": null, "Expr1": null, "UpdateDate": "2011-08-28 09:56:00", "OldUnitId": null, "Bibiliography": {"En": "The Universal Jewish Encyclopedia 5/322;\nZsido Lexikon, p. 358\nMiriam Hejnal\nPeter Reich\nHaim Ghiuzeli\n", "He": null}, "PersonTypeCodesDesc": {"En": "\u05e6\u05d9\u05d9\u05e8|", "He": "Painter|"}, "id": 330165, "UpdateUser": "haim", "UnitDisplayStatus": 2, "PersonTypeIds": "1|", "PrevPicturePaths": null, "TS": "0000000000027099", "FamilyNameIds": null, "MiddleName": {"He": null}, "PictureSources": null, "UnitTypeDesc": "Personality", "PeriodStartDate": "18810000|19720000|", "Slug": {"En": "luminary_herman-lipot", "He": "\u05d0\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea_\u05d4\u05e8\u05de\u05df-\u05dc\u05d9\u05e4\u05d5\u05d8"}, "PeriodDateTypeCode": "1|1|", "RightsDesc": "Full", "IsMainCreatorType": "1|", "UnitText1": {"En": "Herman, Lipot (1881-1972), painter, born in Nagyszentmiklos, Hungary, (then part of Austria-Hungary, today in Romania).

His exhibits in 1912, 1918 and 1922 in Budapest placed him amongst the best known Hungarian painters of his time. In addition to portraits, nudes and landscapes, he drew some battle scenes of World War I (now exhibited in the Regiments Museum, Prague, Czech Republic). Herman is known for his sensuous and colorful compositions on mythological and Biblical subjects. Some of his cartoons were published in 1921 in the form of an album.

Her father was a Jewish banker. Cinema fascinated her and she dropped out of school as a teenager to go into acting. Her first role was in 1932 in the German Movie, \"Geld Auf Der Strase\".  She was discovered by the renowned stage director Max Reinhardt, and gained international notoriety by appearing naked in the Czech film \u2018Ecstasy\u2019 (1933). In the clerical-rightist regime in Vienna, the film was a sensation and caused a scandal. The film was banned in Germany because Kiesler was Jewish and in the USA because of film censorship by the Hays Office.  She made five films in Europe under the name Hedy or Hedwig Kiesler. \n\nHer reputation preceded her to London before she immigrated to Great Britain in 1937. A year later, she boarded the ocean liner \u2018Normandie\u2019 on her way to the USA. The renowned movie producer Louis B. Mayer saw her work and gave her a screen test. He gave her a contract for seven years and changed her name to Hedy Lamarr, in honor of the silent film star, Barbara La Marr. Soon afterwards, not yet 20 years old, she married Fritz Mandel thirty years her senior. He was a wealthy munitions manufacturer and a Nazi sympathizer. It was while married to him that Lamarr gained insight into munitions that was to be so important for her work during World War II. \n\nLamarr's first Hollywood film was \"'Algiers\" (1938), in which she played with Charles Boyer. It brought her immediate stardom. Following this success she was cast with top leading actors like: Robert Taylor in \"Lady Of The Tropics\" (1938), Spencer Tracy in \"I Take This Woman\" (!940), Clark Gable in \"Boom Town\" (1940), and  \"Comrade X\" (1940). In the 1940s she was among the stars of MGM and was thought the most beautiful and glamorous woman in Hollywood. Her performance opposite Robert Young in \"H. M. Pulman Esq.\" (1941) was probably her best. During her Hollywood film career, Lamarr played in over 25 movies. Among the most notable were \"Tortilla Flat\" (1942) and \"White Cargo\" (1942). Her contract with MGM terminated with the comedy \"Her Highness and the Bellboy\" (1945). Lamarr then formed her own production company to play a femme fatale in \"The Strange Woman\" (1946) and in \"Dishonored Lady\" (1947). Her popularity began to decline even after De Mille chose her as Victor Mature\u2019s devious mate in \"Samson and Delila\" (1949). She played in \"Lady Without Passport\" (1950) and in Bob Hope\u2019s \"My Favorite Spy\" (1951).\n\nAbout the beginning of World War II Lamarr became acquainted with a musician, George Anthiel. They discussed what they could do to aid the USA war effort and Lamarr, based on the knowledge she gained during her marriage to Mandel, knew that a torpedo that could be guided was more effective than the radio-controlled used by the USA. Between them, they came up with the idea of how to change frequencies using a player-piano roll developed by Anthiel.  They offered their invention to the USA, but it was never taken seriously. Lamarr, however, continued working for the war effort and raised money for bonds by selling kisses for $50,000.\n\nFollowing her successes through the 1950s her movie career continued to suffer. Lamarr\u2019s somewhat stiff and unyielding personality did not match her beauty. She was temperamental and choosy about her roles. She turned down acting in \"Casablanca\", \"Gaslight\" and \"Saratoga Trunk\". Her part as Joan of Arc in \"The Story of Mankind\" (1957) was badly miscast. In \"The Female Animal\" (1957), she virtually played herself as an aging movie star.\n\nIn the 1950's the Sylvania Company came across Lamarr's and Anthiel's invention and used it during the Cuban Missile crisis. In 2000 Lamarr was given the Electronic Frontier Foundation award for their invention. Anthiel however, also honored, had died much earlier. One of Lamarr's sons accepted the award for her. Lamarr had been married and divorced six times and had three children with her third husband, John Loder. She died, in retirement, in Florida on January 19, 2000", "He": ""}, "UnitText2": {"En": "", "He": ""}, "UnitPlaces": [{"PlaceIds": "66240"}, {"PlaceIds": "74123"}, {"PlaceIds": "74123"}, {"PlaceIds": "98578"}], "UnitStatus": 3, "LastName": {"He": null}, "PeriodDesc": {"En": "1913|2000|", "He": "1913|2000|"}, "PersonTypeCodes": "120|", "UnitHeaderDMSoundex": {"En": "ZZ E869000 ZZ E530000 ZZ ", "He": "ZZ H869000 ZZ H530000 ZZ "}, "PrevPictureFileNames": null, "RightsCode": 1, "PeriodTypeCode": "1|2|", "UnitId": 147040, "IsValueUnit": true, "StatusDesc": "Completed", "NickName": {"He": null}, "UserLexicon": "49375", "EditorRemarks": "", "Attachments": [], "DisplayStatusDesc": "Museum only", "PeriodEndDate": "19139999|20009999|", "PeriodNum": "0|1|", "UnitType": 8, "OtherNames": {"He": null}, "Header": {"En": "Lamarr, Hedy", "He": "\u05dc\u05de\u05d0\u05e8, \u05d4\u05d3\u05d9"}, "PeriodTypeDesc": {"En": "Date of birth|Date of death|", "He": "\u05dc\u05d9\u05d3\u05d4|\u05e4\u05d8\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4|"}, "PersonalityId": 147040, "ForPreview": false, "_id": "147040"}, {"PeriodDateTypeDesc": {"En": "Year|Year|", "He": "\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd|\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd|"}, "FirstName": {"He": null}, "Title": {"He": null}, "LocationInMuseum": "", "Pictures": [], "PictureUnitsIds": null, "related": ["familyname_neuman-91666", "place_budapest", "place_budapest", "place_bratislava", "place_prague", "place_hungary"], "Expr2": null, "Expr1": null, "UpdateDate": "2013-12-26 07:57:00", "OldUnitId": null, "Bibiliography": {"En": "The Universal Jewish Encyclopedia 8/ 160;\nZsido Lexikon p.  652\nMiriam Hajnal\nPeter Reich\nHaim Ghiuzeli", "He": null}, "PersonTypeCodesDesc": {"En": "\u05e1\u05d5\u05e4\u05e8|\u05de\u05d7\u05e0\u05da|", "He": "Author|Educator|"}, "id": 357540, "UpdateUser": "haim", "UnitDisplayStatus": 2, "PersonTypeIds": "1|2|", "PrevPicturePaths": null, "TS": "00000000001dad03", "FamilyNameIds": "91666|", "MiddleName": {"He": null}, "PictureSources": null, "UnitTypeDesc": "Personality", "PeriodStartDate": "17690000|18310000|", "Slug": {"En": "luminary_neumann-moses-samuel", "He": "\u05d0\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea_\u05e0\u05d5\u05d9\u05de\u05df-\u05de\u05e9\u05d4-\u05e9\u05de\u05d5\u05d0\u05dc"}, "PeriodDateTypeCode": "1|1|", "RightsDesc": "Full", "IsMainCreatorType": "1|0|", "UnitText1": {"En": "Neumann, Moses Samuel (1769-1831), Hebrew author and educator, born in Ban, Hungary (then part of the Austrain Empire).

Son of a rabbi, he received a strict religious upbringing in the Talmudic schools of Kackenbach and Golcuv-Jenikov, Bohemia (now in the Czech Republic), and managed under great difficulties to obtain a secular education in Bratislava (now in Slovakia) and at Prague University, where he studied German literature. He also studied Jewish theology under S. J. Rapoport, and was ordained a rabbi in 1844. \n\nIn 1845 he moved to Vienna, where he founded an elementary and secondary school for boys in 1849, which combined Jewishness with modern secular learning. It became the first Jewish school in Austria entitled to issue officially valid diplomas. Szanto taught Bible and Hebrew literature at the Vienna Beit ha-Midrash; he was also appointed inspector for Jewish religious instruction at public schools and official interpreter of the Hebrew language, and became a lecturer at the Theologische Lehrantstalt. \n\nIn 1861 he founded, with Leopold Kompert, a weekly journal, \"Die Neuzeit\", which he edited until his death. He contributed to the \"Jahrbuch fuer Israeliten\" and was its editor from 1865 to 1868.\n\nSzanto was a prolific writer with a precise and lively style, writing a large portion of \"Die Neuzeit\" himself as well as many articles in the Jewish and Vienna daily press, chiefly on education. He wrote: \"Bocer Olelosz\" (a Bible commentary, 1845), two historic novels: \"Bilder aus Alexandrias Vorzeit\" and \"Judentum und Romantik\"; \"Schullerers Paradaxa\"; \"Fahrende Juden\"; \"Sturmpetition eines Paedagogen\"; \"Musterung zur Charakteristik der Erzieherwelt\" (1857-1858); \"Schematismus der israelit. Cultusgemeinden in der Oesterr. Monarchie\" (1869), and \"Ibn Karmi\" (pseudonim, 1871).  \n\nSzanto also wrote  many essays on Jewish history, some in Hebrew. He was a devoted follower of Adolf Jellinek and a forceful fighter for his ideas of Jewish reform, and he participated in the Reform synods of Leipzig and Augsburg.", "He": ""}, "UnitText2": {"En": "", "He": ""}, "UnitPlaces": [{"PlaceIds": "72907"}, {"PlaceIds": "72951"}, {"PlaceIds": "72997"}, {"PlaceIds": "74123"}, {"PlaceIds": "74123"}], "UnitStatus": 3, "LastName": {"He": null}, "PeriodDesc": {"En": "1819|1882|", "He": "1819|1882|"}, "PersonTypeCodes": "149|254|", "UnitHeaderDMSoundex": {"En": "ZZ E463000 ZZ E466000 ZZ ", "He": "ZZ H463000 H463700 ZZ H466000 ZZ H466000 ZZ "}, "PrevPictureFileNames": null, "RightsCode": 1, "PeriodTypeCode": "1|2|", "UnitId": 158711, "IsValueUnit": true, "StatusDesc": "Completed", "NickName": {"He": null}, "UserLexicon": null, "EditorRemarks": "", "Attachments": [], "DisplayStatusDesc": "Museum only", "PeriodEndDate": "18199999|18829999|", "PeriodNum": "0|1|", "UnitType": 8, "OtherNames": {"He": null}, "Header": {"En": "Szanto, Simon", "He": "\u05e1\u05d0\u05e0\u05d8\u05d5, \u05e1\u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05df (\u05e9\u05de\u05e2\u05d5\u05df)"}, "PeriodTypeDesc": {"En": "Date of birth|Date of death|", "He": "\u05dc\u05d9\u05d3\u05d4|\u05e4\u05d8\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4|"}, "PersonalityId": 158711, "ForPreview": false, "_id": "158711"}, {"LocationInMuseum": null, "Pictures": [{"PictureUrl": "https://storage.googleapis.com/bhs-flat-pics/17282601-CDDE-4B03-94C6-1B9A96F37237.jpg", "PictureId": "17282601-CDDE-4B03-94C6-1B9A96F37237", "IsPreview": "1"}], "PictureUnitsIds": "130716|", "related": ["image_the-synagogue-in-luck-luka-czechoslovakia-c1930"], "UpdateDate": "2016-04-27 10:13:00", "OldUnitId": "HB001152.HTM-EB001736.HTM", "id": 188937, "UpdateUser": "administrator", "PrevPictureFileNames": "313.I.69.4.jpg|", "PrevPicturePaths": "Photos\\17282601-cdde-4b03-94c6-1b9a96f37237.jpg|", "PlaceTypeCode": 8, "TS": "00000000005a7cb4", "PlaceTypeDesc": {"En": "Village", "He": "\u05db\u05e4\u05e8"}, "UnitType": 5, "UnitTypeDesc": "Place", "EditorRemarks": "hasavot from Places ", "UnitStatus": 3, "RightsDesc": "Full", "Bibiliography": {"En": "Encyclopedia Judaica", "He": "\u05de\u05e7\u05d5\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05e6'\u05db\u05d5\u05e1\u05dc\u05d5\u05d1\u05e7\u05d9\u05d4, \u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05d9\u05d9\u05e0\u05dc"}, "UnitText1": {"En": "Luka\n\nGerman: Luck\n\nA village and municipality, Liberec Region, Czech Republic\n\nAccording to tradition, Jews from Bavaria founded the town in the 11th century; there are local records of Jews living in the town in 1198. \n\nRecords from 1432 mention a Jewish \"place of worship.\" Later, in 1842, the synagogue and community records were damaged in a fire. \n\nDuring the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) the community was nearly decimated by the plague.\n \nThe Jews from Luka, like those from Hroznetin (German: Lichtenstadt), did business in nearby Carlsbad. \n\nDuring the 19th century Feibel (Phillip) Kohn served as the mayor for 28 years. A Reform and an Orthodox rabbi served the community.\n   \nIn 1848, Jews throughout the Austrian Empire, including Luka, were emancipated and residence and economic restrictions were subsequently lifted. As a result, many Jews throughout the region began moving to larger towns and cities, seeking greater economic and educational opportunities. In Luka, Jews had begun moving elsewhere even before 1848 and the emancipation served only to accelerate the community's decline. In 1850 there were 1,150 Jews lived in Luka (80% of the total population). By 1869 the population had dropped to 446. By 1930 there were not enough Jews living in Luka for a minyan.\n \nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nBy the time the Nazis invaded, few to no Jews were living in Luka.

17th century through the 20th century, as well as a pre-burial house and monuments to Jewish soldiers. The cemetery is owned by the Jewish community of Brno, and can be accessed freely. \n\nHISTORY\n\nIt is believed that the first Jews settled in Miroslav after they were expelled from the Moravian royal cities in 1454. Records from the Ottoman-Hapsburg wars (16th-18th centuries) mention a Jewish community in the town. That community subsequently dwindled to only three families, but the population began to recover when it began absorbing refugees from the Chmielnicki Massacres (1648-1649). In 1666 there were 20 Jews who were expelled from the town. Jews from Vienna later settled in the town, bringing the town's total Jewish population to 18 families. Legally 119 Jewish families were permitted to live in Miroslav. \n\nIn 1753 there were 64 families living in 18 houses. By 1801 there were 448 Jews (18% of the total population) living in the town, a number that did not change by 1820. \n\nIn 1831 local Jewish resident Rafael Koenig (b. 1808) became the first Jewish locksmith in the Hapsburg Empire. \n\nA Reform-style synagogue was built in 1845. An independent Jewish political community was established in 1867; it was later incorporated into the municipality in 1924. \n\nThe Jewish population reached its peak in 1857, when it numbered 1,032 people. With the removal of residence restrictions after the 1848 emancipation of Jews throughout the Austrian Empire, many Jews began moving to larger towns and cities, seeking greater economic and educational opportunities and greatly reducing the populations of smaller towns and villages. The Jewish population of Miroslav subsequently declined to 424 in 1869, though it rose slightly, to 528 people, in 1900. During World War I approximately 350 refugees fled to Miroslav, but few settled there permanently. In 1930 the community numbered 291 people (6.6% of the total). \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nIn March, 1939 the region of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews living there. The Jewish community of Miroslav was sent to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto in 1942. From there they were deported to concentration and death camps, where most perished. Before the community was sent to Terezin, ritual objects and synagogue equipment from Miroslav was sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague.\n\nPOSTWAR\n\nMany of the buildings that stood in the Jewish Quarter were preserved. In 1999 students from the Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, the Netherlands, and Slovakia worked to restore the Jewish cemetery in Miroslav.

"Boskovice\n\nGerman: Boskowitz\n\nA town in south Moravia, Czech Republic\n\nThe town of Boskovice was founded during the 15th century and is located about 20 miles (32km) northeast of Brno, the capital of Moravia. Until 1918 the area was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After the collapse of the empire following World War I, and until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Since 1993 it has been part of the Czech Republic. \n\nOf Boskovice's three synagogues, only the Great Synagogue survived World War II. Conservation and restoration work was carried out during the late 1980s, and by 1994 most of the structural issues and exterior conservation work had been done. Between 2000 and 2002 the remaining preservation work was carried out, thanks to grants from a number of organizations, including the World Monument Fund's Jewish Heritage Program. The fully restored building remains standing in its original location. \n\nThe location of Boskovice's first cemetery is unknown. However, a second cemetery, which was most likely established during the 17th century, still exists. The tomb of Rabbi Samuel ben Nathan HaLevi Kolin, the author of Makhatsit HaShekel and the director of the town's yeshiva for more than 60 years, can be found there. \n\nSince 1993 the town has hosted an annual summer cultural festival dedicated to preserving and restoring the town's Jewish quarter. \n\nHISTORY\n\nThe Jewish community of Boskovice was among the oldest in Moravia; during the reign of Karl IV in the 14th century it was also one of the largest. A tombstone from the year 1069 is the earliest evidence of a Jewish presence in Boskovice; later, a court document from 1243 also evidences a Jewish presence there. In 1454 the Jews were expelled from the royal towns of Moravia (free towns not under regional jurisdiction) and some, particularly from Brno, came to Boskovice. Jewish residence was limited to a Jewish street, and on Sundays and Christian holidays Jews were forbidden from entering other parts of the town. \n\nThe overcrowding in the Jewish Quarter could be dangerous; in 1715 an epidemic broke out within the Jewish Quarter, leaving 892 dead and the Jewish Quarter quarantined for a year. A fire that broke out on May 1, 1823 destroyed the entire Jewish Quarter, along with 20 houses from the Christian part of the town. A cholera epidemic in 1866 during the Prussian War claimed many Jewish victims, and turned the Jewish school into a temporary hospital. Another fire broke out in 1882, and in 1906 there was an explosion in a warehouse owned by a Jewish merchant in which 40 Jewish people perished.\n\nBy the 16th century there were enough Jews living in Boskovice that they established, and subsequently expanded, a cemetery. During the 17th century the community formed a more formal organizational structure and was led by a Jewish official who was responsible for arbitrating internal issues, as well as a committee of \"Landesaltester:\" rabbis, religious judges, and melamdim (teachers). There were three synagogues: the Great Synagogue, which was built in 1698 and subsequently renovated three times, a second synagogue that was built during the 18th century and which also served as a beit midrash, and a third synagogue financed by the Low-Beer family that was built in 1884. The Jewish school also had a place to pray, and for Rosh Hashana additional prayer services were set up in the Jewish kindergarten (which later served as a gathering place for the community). \n\nBoskovice became a well-known religious center. Among the rabbis serving the community were Rabbi Yehudah Oppenheim of Worms, Rabbi Nehemia Yaffe of Krakow, Rabbi Natan Adler, Rabbi Issachar Baer Bloch of Hamburg, Rabbi Mosher Sofer, Rabbi Shmuel Halevy Kolin and his son Rabbi Benjamin Zeev Boskovic who founded a yeshiva in the town, Rabbi Avraham Platzek, who served as the chief rabbi of Moravia between 1851 and 1884, and Rabbi Salomon Funk. The last rabbi to serve the community was Isidor Reich. Many of these rabbis wrote influential books, while some were also active in the Zionist movement. \n\nA Jewish school is referenced in 1591. Over time additional classes were added for boys and girls, who were taught separately. In 1855 the school was turned into a Hauptschule (a German secondary school), and was considered to be one of the best Jewish schools in Moravia. The community established a Jewish hospital, a mikvah, a chevra kaddisha, an organization to support the sick, a loan society, a women's society, and a first aid organization. There were also several Jewish firefighters and policemen. During the summer of 1938 a course for training Jewish teachers was held in the town. \n\nIn the beginning, the Jews of Boskovice were subject to economic restrictions; in 1565 they were allowed to own land, but were forbidden from supplying goods to the villages. During the 17th and 18th centuries most worked as traders and artisans but over the course of the 19th century Boskovice became a center for the new ready-made clothing industry, due particularly to the Schwarz, Ticho, Munk, and Low-Beer families, who established textile factories in the town. In addition to funding the construction of a new synagogue, mentioned previously, the Low-Beer family also established a number of charitable organizations to serve the Jews of Boskovice. Others worked in professionals fields and as artists. The eye specialist Dr. Avraham Ticho, the historian Oscar K. Rabinovitz, the German writer and member of the Prague Circle Herman Unger, and Dr. Moritz (Moshe) Zobel, one of the chief editors of the German-language Encyclopedia Judaica, were from Boskovice. \n\nAfter 1848, when the Jews of Moravia received full civil and religious rights, a number of civil, social, and economic activities became available to the Jews of the area. This prompted many to leave for larger towns and cities, particularly Brno and Vienna. However, the town was a popular vacation spot and during the interwar period the town's population would increase during the summer. \n\nA sports organization was formed in 1909 which, during the 1920s, became a chapter of Maccabi. A Zionist organization was also founded around the same time. The organization Agudas Yisroel was also active. Students formed a vacation organization for the promotion of Zionism during their vacations, and in 1926 the Jews of Boskovice contributed in order to receive membership and voting rights at the Zionist Congress; during the elections to the 20th Zionist congress in 1937, there were 37 Jews from Boskovice who voted. \n\nIn 1930, after the Republic of Czechoslovakia recognized the Jews as a national minority, more than 75% of the community declared themselves as belonging to the Jewish nation.  \n\nIn 1793 there were 300 Jewish families living in Boskovice; by 1830 there were 326 families (a total of 1,595 people), and by 1857 there were 2,018 Jews living in Boskovice. Towards the end of the 19th century, Jews began moving to larger towns and cities, resulting in a population decline. By 1900 there were 598 Jews living in Boskovice and 116 houses were owned by Jews. In 1930 there were 395 Jews living in Boskovice (about 6% of the total population). \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of September 29, 1938, about a year before the outbreak of World War II, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved. The areas of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany on March 15, 1939, after which the Jews living in the area were gradually deprived of their rights and properties. \n\nBeginning in November 1941 the Germans concentrated the Jews remaining in the Czech territory in the Terezin (German: Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps, mainly in Poland, where most were killed. Approximately 473 Jews from Boskovice and the surrounding area were killed during the Holocaust. \n\nBefore the expulsion from Boskovice, 1,244 documents, 139 books, and 351 ritual articles belonging to the community were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague.\n\nAfter the war, very few Jews returned to Boskovice. Of those who chose to remain in the country, many settled in Brno. In 1948 there were 60 Jews registered in the community of Boskovice. An additional 27 Jews were not registered. During the 1980s the Jewish Quarter was still well-preserved. \n\n\n", "He": "\u05d1\u05d5\u05e1\u05e7\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05e6\u05d4 BOSKOVICE\n(\u05d1\u05d2\u05e8\u05de\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea

town in north Bohemia, Czech Republic\n\nThe cemetery of Budyne is located near privately-owned farmland and a fruit orchard. In addition to a number of gravestones dating from the end of the 18th century until the 20th century, there is also a pre-burial house with a tahara (where the body is prepared for burial) on the cemetery grounds. Tombstone inscriptions are written in Hebrew, German, and Czech. \n\nHISTORY\n\nBudyne nad Ohri is located about 4 miles (6km) east of town of Libochovice. Until 1918 the area was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After the collapse of the empire following World War I, and until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Since 1993 it has been part of the Czech Republic. \n\nBy the 13th and 14th centuries there were already Jews living in Budyne. From 1336 until 1848, when the Jews of Bohemia were emancipated and received the rights of citizenship, the Jews lived under the protection of the nobles of the houses of Hazmburk, Sternberg, and Dietrichstein. The Jewish Quarter was located in the northern part of the town, close to the wall. One of the more interesting pieces of evidence attesting to a Jewish presence in Budyne is a Hebrew inscription that was discovered in the building of a flour mill. The plaque, which indicates that a Jewish man named Avraham was the leased the old mill by Jan of Hazmburk in 1536 in order to fund a journey to Palestine, was reaffixed over the entrance to the newer mill.\n\nMost of the town's Jews originally worked as moneylenders and merchants. According to the Numerus Secundus laws of 1650, the Jews were permitted to trade, to set up stands at the marketplace, and to participate in fairs. They then began trading mainly in skins, furs, wool, grain, cattle, meat, and dried fish. They also owned vineyards and from 1691 until 1871 they supplied liquor to the nobility. \n\nBy 1632 the community purchased and established a building as a prayer house and opened a school; the synagogue would later be burned down in 1759 and rebuilt in 1821. Many members of the community were forced to sell their houses including the community building, to their Czech neighbors after a 1676 ruling that forbade Jews from owning property alongside that of non-Jews. A year later the community building was returned to Jewish owners. \n\nThe cemetery was located close to the wall, behind the tower however, in 1670 the mayor of the town took the tombstones and used them in order to pave the town's wine cellar. In 1707 the Jewish community bought land for a street in order to allow for a more direct route to the cemetery. As a result of the decree of Emperor Joseph II in 1785 that forbade the existence of cemeteries within a city's walls, the community was forced to relocate the cemetery. \n\nIn 1715, after a plague that broke out in the Jewish Quarter, the Jews were quarantined in a field outside of the town. Relatively shortly thereafter, the \"Law of Families\" decreed by Emperor Karl VI of 1726 limited the number of Jewish families in Budyne to 32. \n\nDuring the 19th century the school's location kept shifting according to where the teacher was living. It was only in 1859, thanks to the donation of Mrs. Gavriella Taussig, that a building was erected for a school. The language of instruction was German, but Hebrew was also taught and beginning in 1870 schools were also required to teach the Czech language. The community also had a private school. Towards the end of the 19th century, following the migration of Jews all over the region to bigger towns and cities, the private school and the community school were closed down, at which point the Jewish children went to the general school where the language of instruction was Czech; what was once the school building was converted into a residence for the rabbi. \n\nAmong the rabbis in the community were Rabbi Jacob Loewenfeld, Rabbi Jacob Langfelder, Rabbi Naftali Koch, and Rabbi Moritz Lemberger. For several years after Rabbi Lemberger served the community there were only melamdim (teachers) and no officially appointed rabbi. In 1897 Bernard Levy was appointed as the community's rabbi and, for the first time, he was permitted as a rabbi to marry couples; until then only the rabbis of Prague were allowed to perform wedding ceremonies. \n\nBudyne had a chevra kaddisha, a Bikkur Holim, and a Tehum Shabbat. The community had a special custom of celebrating the festival of Sukkot outside of the walls.\n\nBy 1930 there were 39 Jews living in Budyne.  \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of September 29, 1938, about a year before the outbreak of World War II, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved. The areas of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany on March 15, 1939, after which the Jews living in the area were gradually deprived of their rights and properties. \n\nBeginning in November 1941 the Germans concentrated the Jews remaining in the Czech territory in the Terezin (German: Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps, mainly in Poland, where most were killed. Before the expulsion from Budyne, 47 ritual articles were transferred to the Jewish Museum in Prague.\n\nAfter the war the synagogue was converted into a warehouse. \n", "He":

Bohemia, Usti nad Labem Region, Czech Republic\n\nIn 2008 a stone monument was unveiled to commemorate the Jews of Chomutov. A Star of David marks the location where the Jewish cemetery once stood. \n\nHISTORY\n\nThe first mention of Jews in Chomutov references those who martyred themselves in 1421 rather than be forcibly baptized by the Hussites. Between 1468 and 1526 the municipal records list 50 Jews as homeowners, though in 1517 the Jews were expelled from the town. \n\nAfter 1848, when the Jews of the Austro-Hungarian Empire were emancipated and residence restrictions were lifted, Jews from the surrounding communities moved to Chomutov, attracted by its developing industry. \n\nBetween 1860 and 1869 tensions arose between the Jews living in Chomutov and the larger community of Udlice over the establishment of a prayer room in Chomutov. The leaders of Udlice, who had authority over the Jews of Chomutov, felt that the prayer house threatened the existence of the Udlice community and they repeatedly threatened to close it. \nAdditional Jewish communities existed in the small towns and villages surrounding Chomutov and were affiliated with its community. These included:\n\nHorenice (German: Horschentz). Jews settled in Horenice in 1688 with the encouragement of the authorities. A Jewish Quarter, which was built with a unique architectural style, was established. A record from 1748 mentions a synagogue; a new synagogue was built in 1839, though it eventually ceased to function as a synagogue in 1901 and the building was destroyed during World War I. The Jewish cemetery includes a mass grave of Jews who perished during a death march in March, 1945.\n\nBilence (German: Bielenz). In 1767 records indicate that 15 apartments belonged to Jews. A community ledger began to be kept in 1826. After the emancipation of 1848 the Jews of Bilence, like Jews from other small communities, began moving to larger towns and cities, resulting in the community's decline. The Jewish economist, Gustav Schoenfeld, who lived in Bilence, bought the synagogue building and donated it to the local council on the condition that it would be used as a shelter for the poor, regardless of their religion, and that the council would preserve the Jewish cemetery. By the beginning of the 1930s only two Jewish families remained in Bilence.\n\nDermoul (German: Duerrmaul). By the 16th century there were already several Jewish families living in Dermoul. Beginning in the 17th century until 1938, when the Sudeten Region was annexed to Nazi Germany, Dermoul was home to a Jewish community. Eighteen Jewish families lived in Dermoul in the middle of the 18th century, and 29 families lived in Dermoul by the middle of the 19th century. The Jewish Quarter was at the center of the town, and included the community house and the synagogue, which was built in 1803 (both the community house and the synagogue were destroyed in 1981). \n\nJirkov (German: Goerkau). Many Jewish families lived in Jirkov at the beginning of the 19th century and the community was affiliated with the Jewish community of Dermoul. In 1846 Jirkov's Jewish population was 130, and they lived in 40 houses. Countess Gabriela von Buquoi donated a site in 1844 for the Jews to build a synagogue; that synagogue was consecrated in 1853 and a special prayer was recited on Shabbat in honor of the countess. The community had its own chevra kaddisha, and a new cemetery was consecrated in 1864. Fifteen Jewish families were living in Jirkov during the 1930s. The synagogue building was used as a warehouse during the 1990s.\n\nAfter the emancipation of 1848 and the subsequent removal of residence restrictions, Jewish populations in rural areas began to decline as people left seeking greater economic and educational opportunities in larger towns and cities. In 1890 the communities of Udlice, Horenice, Bilence, and Dermoul became affiliated with the community of Chomutov.\n\nThere were 100 families living in Chomutov in 1873 when the congregation was officially formed. Three years later, in 1876, a synagogue was built. By 1893 most of the neighboring communities had been dissolved, while those that remained became affiliated with Chomutov. At that point, the larger Chomutov community numbered 911 people in 14 locations. \n\nIn 1930 there were 444 people living in the community (1.3% of the total population), and there was an active communal life. \n\nAt the beginning of the Sudeten crisis of February 1938, the Jewish residents left Chomutov, which was reported as \"Judenrein\" (free of Jews) on September 23, 1938. \n\nAfter World War II a small congregation was reestablished in Chomutov, administered by the community of Usti nad Labem.  \n\n", "He": "\u05db\u05d5\u05de\u05d5\u05d8\u05d5\u05d1

Republic\n\nUntil 1918, Damborice was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; after World War I it became part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia.\n\nAbout 400 tombstones have remained standing in the Jewish cemetery of Damborice, the oldest dating to 1700. The cemetery is owned by the Jewish community of Brno. \n\nHISTORY\n\nJewish taxpayers are referred to in records from Damborice dating to 1617. At that time there were 9 Jewish families living in the village under the protection of the local ruler. Most of the Jews of Damborice were peddlers, though some worked as cattle dealers. By the end of the 17th century there were 20 homes owned by Jews. At the beginning of the 18th century, however, a Jewish Quarter was established, which was almost entirely burned down during a fire in 1769. After the fire, the local duke gave the Jewish community a loan to rebuild their houses and the synagogue. \n\nFires and other natural disasters continued to wreak havoc within the Jewish Quarter. In 1807 the rebuilt synagogue was destroyed, along with the community's register. In another fire in 1824 all of the Jewish-owned buildings except for one were destroyed. Additional damage was incurred after floods in 1833, 1849, 1854, and 1856. In 1836, 1849, and 1850 a number of Jews died in epidemics. \n\nTombstones dating from around 1700 indicate that a cemetery had been established by then. A chevra kaddisha served the community. Other communal institutions included charity organizations and an organization to provide temporary housing for Jewish travelers. There was also a mikvah (ritual bath) and a community house. The community's leader was referred to as \"the judge of the Jews\" and the members of the Jewish council were referred to as \"the jury.\" \n\nIn the beginning, Jewish children attended the regular school and had religious lessons in the afternoon. However, in 1862 the community founded an elementary school in which the language of instruction was German. At its peak, the school enrolled 95 children. It would eventually close in 1919. \n\nRabbi Shmuel Hahn, who served as the rabbi of the district, was appointed as the community's rabbi in 1863. He was quite influential, and served until his death in 1917. He was succeeded by Rabbi Dr. Ernst Reich, who served until 1923. Rabbi Dr. Heinrich Schwenger was appointed in 1923, and also served the town of Breclav. In addition to a rabbi, the community also employed a cantor and a shochet (kosher butcher). \n\nIn 1798 there were 326 Jews living in the village. By 1848 that number had risen to 405. 1836 there were 431 Jews living in Damborice, in 56 houses. The community reached its peak population in 1857, when there were 476 Jews living in the village.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, after Jews throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire had been emancipated and Jews could live where they chose and choose their profession, many Jews left Demborice for bigger towns and cities, in search of better educational and economic opportunities. Only a small number of small traders and artisans remained. The census of 1900 records that there were only 144 Jews living in the village. By 1930 that number had dropped to 46. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of September 29, 1938, about a year before the outbreak of World War II, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved. The areas of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany on March 15, 1939, after which the Jews living in the area were gradually deprived of their rights and properties. \n\nBeginning in November 1941 the Germans concentrated the Jews remaining in the Czech territory in the Terezin (German: Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps, mainly in Poland, where most were killed.\n\nBefore their deportation to Terezin, 58 documents and 14 ritual objects from the community of Damborice were transferred to the Jewish Museum in Prague. \n", "He": "\u05d3\u05d0\u05de\u05d1\u05d5\u05d6'\u05d9\u05e6\u05d4 Damborice\r\n\r\n\u05d1\u05d2\u05e8\u05de\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea:

Bohemia, the former Sudeten region, Czech Republic\n\nDecin and Podmokly were originally separate towns, both founded during the 13th century. In 1942, when the region was annexed to Nazi Germany, the Germans united the two towns. Later, Podmokly became a borough of Decin. The region was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until 1918. After the fall of the empire following World War I and during the postwar communist era, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. \n\nDecin's synagogue was the only one from the former Sudeten Region to have survived World War II. After it was returned to the Jewish community during the 1990s and added to the national register of cultural landmarks, the Jewish community renovated the dilapidated and decaying building. The reconstructed synagogue is open to the public. \n\nHISTORY\n\nBy the 17th century, long before the Jews came to settle, Jewish merchants from Poland would come to the towns to conduct business, mostly in exporting paper that was produced in Decin. It appears that there were no Jews living in Podmokly before the year 1700. In contrast, Jews were living in Decin before 1537, though they were later expelled and able to return only after the emancipation of the Jews in the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1848 and the subsequent lifting of residence restrictions. At that point, the Jews of Decin and of Podmokly formed one united community.  \n\nReligious services were held in private homes beginning in 1874. A prayer house located in the courtyard of the manufacturer Adolf Paacher was too small for all of the worshippers, so holiday services were held in public halls. In 1885 a synagogue society was founded and in 1887, when there were 162 Jews living in the community, a religious society was formed. This society became the basis of the official Jewish community, which was recognized in 1895; its regulations were approved in 1896. Rabbi Max Freund served as the community's rabbi until his death in 1918. He was eventually succeeded in Decin by Rabbi Dr. Oscar Karpelis.\n\nAmong the community's founders were the manufacturer Adolf Paachter, a resident of Podmokly and the community's first president, and Sigmund Branner, a resident of Decin and the community's vice president. \n\nA synagogue was built in the art nouveau style in 1907 on Zizkova Street, close to Podmokly's railway station. A chevra kaddisha was formed in 1888 and a Jewish cemetery was dedicated in 1890. The community also had a library. Jewish children attended German-language schools and were provided with religious instruction by Adolf Lederer. By 1921, with the Jewish population of the two towns totaling 423, there was also a women's society, and a charity fund. The Jews also became involved in the town's public life during the 19th century. Dr. Joseph Eckstein, a lawyer, was born in Podmokly in 1866; he later moved to Prague and became a member of the Council of Prague and fought for the rights of the German residents of Prague. \n\nAfter World War I, the Republic of Czechoslovakia recognized the Jews as a national minority. At that point a number of Zionist organizations and youth movements, particularly the Zionist youth movement Blau Weiss, became active in the towns. There was also a branch of the women's Zionist organization WIZO. The local Jews acquired voting rights during the 1926 and 1927 elections to the Zionist Congress, and in 1937 there were 60 members of the community who took part in elections to the 20th Zionist Congress. Dr. Fritz Eckstein was elected as the head of the Theodor Herzl Organization.  \n\nIn 1930 there were 515 Jews living in Decin and Podmokly; 354 were living in Podmokly, and 161 were living in Decin. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nThe Munich Agreement of September 1938 led to the dissolution of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, and annexed the Sudeten Region, which included Decin and Podmokly, to Nazi Germany. As a result, most of the Jews of the region moved to Bohemia and Moravia. In March 1939 the region of Bohemia and Moravia were annexed to Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews of the region. \n\nBeginning in 1941 the Germans began deporting Czech Jews to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps, where most were killed. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nIt is not known if any survivors from the original community returned to Decin or Podmokly after the war. Jewish life was instead revived by Jews who came from the east of Czechoslovakia. They celebrated Jewish holidays, held concerts, and hosted services in one of the rooms of the synagogue. In 1948 there were 610 Jews in both parts of the town. Subsequently, however, most of the Jews emigrated. The synagogue was converted into a district archive, but returned to the Jewish community in 1996 and given landmark status. \n\nApproximately 50 tombstones were moved from the Podmokly cemetery to Decin, where they were subsequently sold or stolen. After a number of acts of vandalism, the site was converted into a park. \n\n\n\n", "He": "\u05d3\u05d9\u05d9\u05e6'\u05d9\u05df Decin\r\n\r\n\u05d1\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8

Czech Republic\n\nDivisov was founded in 1545 and is located 8 miles (13km) east of the town of Benesov. Until 1918 the region was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; after World War I and until 1933 it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia.\n\nOne of the Torah scrolls from Divisov which had been sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague in 1941 and which made its way to London after the war, was subsequently acquired by Temple Oheb Shalom in Baltimore. \n\nThe Jewish cemetery is owned by the Jewish community of Prague. Many of the tombstones have been preserved, as has the pre-burial house. \n\nIn 2004 the synagogue building, which had been converted into a hairdresser's shop, was reconstructed and converted into a Jewish museum.  Exhibits depict the history of the Jewish community of Divisov. \n\nHISTORY\n\nJews began living in Divisov during the mid-17th century and an organized community was established in 1776. Though they were not restricted to living in any particular area, most of the Jewish homes were concentrated in the northeast of the town square, on a road leading to Cesky Sternberk. \n\nA synagogue was built during the middle of the 19th century, though beginning in 1893 it was used only during holidays and festivals. The community also included a cemetery, a Jewish school, and a mikvah. For a long time the communities of Divisov, Benesov, and Neveklov shared common institutions. \n\nIn 1893 the Jewish community of Divisov contained 250 people. At the turn of the 20th century, however, many moved to larger towns and cities, part of a larger trend in the area following the emancipation of Jews throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the subsequent lifting of many social and economic restrictions. By 1921 only 128 Jews remained in Divisov.  The already-small population dropped to 20 by 1930, at which point the community was dissolved. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of September 1938, about a year before the outbreak of World War II, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was disbanded. Beginning in March 1939 Bohemia and Moravia were occupied by Nazi Germany and became a protectorate of the Third Reich, beginning a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews remaining in these regions. By the end of 1941 most of the Jews remaining in the protectorate had been concentrated in the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were deported to concentration and death camps, mostly in Poland, where most were killed. \n\nBefore the community's deportation to the Terezin Ghetto, approximately 40 ritual objects from the community of Divisov were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague.\n\nPOSTWAR\n\nIt is not known if any of the Jews of Divisov survived the war. The building that once housed the synagogue was converted into a hairdresser's shop in 1957.

Republic\n\nDlouha Ves is located about 17 miles (27km) from the town of Klatovy. Until 1918 the region was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; after World War I and until 1933 it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe partially-reconstructed cemetery of Dlouha Ves still exists, as does the cemetery of Kasperske Hory which is owned by the Jewish community of Plzen. \n\nThe synagogue in Dlouha Ves was destroyed in 1937 and the prayer house in Kundratice was destroyed in 1946. While one of the prayer houses in Kasperske Hory was destroyed during the 1960s, the other has remained standing.\n\nHISTORY \n\nAt the beginning of the 18th century there were approximately 20 Jewish families living in Dlouha Ves, making up the majority of the village's population; by the middle of the century the number of Jewish families rose to 37. Most of the Jews lived in the center of the village, where there was also a two-story synagogue (this synagogue would be burned down in 1937). Tombstones in the Jewish cemetery dated from the first half of the 18th century. \n\nAfter the Jews of the Austro-Hungarian Empire were emancipated in 1848, and many of the restrictions against them were lifted, Jews began moving from more rural areas into larger towns and cities in search of educational and economic opportunities. As a result, smaller Jewish communities throughout the region, including Dlouha Ves, gradually declined in numbers. By 1921 there were only 13 Jews still living in the village, and community life had shifted to neighboring communities. \n\nOne of those communities was Kasperske Hory (German: Bergreichstein), a town located approximately 4 miles (7km) away from Dlouha Ves. Kasperske Hory had a prayer house and a synagogue, and by 1921 there were still 51 Jews living in the town. The head of the community at that time was Sigmund Bloch, and the rabbi serving the community was J. Ueberall. The census of 1930 found 28 Jews living in the town, 6 of whom declared their nationality as Jewish. The graphic artist and poet Joseph Hahn was born in Kasperske Hory in 1917. The communities of Dlouha Bes and Kasperske Hory merged in 1890. \n\nKundratice (German: Kundratitz), a village located approximately 3 miles (5km) from Dlouha Ves, also had a synagogue that was built during the 19th century. In 1921 there were 54 Jews living in the village. The community was led by Beno Glaser and Rabbi Yehezkel Nussbaum. The community maintained a Jewish cemetery, as well as a chevra kaddisha. The 1930 census found 33 Jews in the area, 10 of whom declared their nationality as Jewish. \n\nProsteredni Kruses (German: Mittel Koernsalz), located less than 2 miles (3km) from Dlouha Ves, also had a prayer house that was established during the 19th century. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of September 1938, about a year before the outbreak of World War II, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was disbanded. Most of the Jews living in the region moved to inner Bohemia and Moravia, which was still independent. Beginning in March 1939, however, Bohemia and Moravia were occupied by Nazi Germany and became a protectorate of the Third Reich, beginning a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews remaining in these regions. By the end of 1943 most of the Jews remaining in the protectorate had been concentrated in the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were deported to concentration and death camps, mostly in Poland, where most were killed. \n\nDuring the war, the Jewish cemetery in Dlouha Ves was destroyed by the Nazis. After the war, in 1945, German soldiers, under the supervision of Czech soldiers, were forced to return the tombstones and repair the cemetery. \n", "He": "\u05d3\u05dc\u05d5\u05d0\u05d5\u05d4

is located between Prague and Bavaria, in a forested area approximately 25 miles (40km) from Prague. Until 1918 the region was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; after World War I and until 1933 it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe Jewish cemetery is owned by the Jewish community of Prague. While its borders have shrunk due to the building of a tennis and miniature golf courts as well as two cemetery reductions, it is nonetheless still able to be accessed. A few hundred tombstones, with Hebrew, German, and Czech inscriptions, are still standing. \n\nThe synagogue building, which had been converted into a cultural center, is still standing. The exterior was restored to reflect its original appearance when it was a synagogue. \n\nHISTORY\n\nThe first documented evidence of Jewish life at Dobris dates to 1645; additionally, a tombstone in the Jewish cemetery dates to 1650. Not much documentation about the Jews of Dobris from that time survives; the first official records of the Jews were kept by the Catholic Church, and the community itself did not maintain their own register until 1866. Though the Jews of Dobris were prohibited from buying land, others in the town permitted them to build houses on their lots. As a result, Jewish houses were spread throughout the town, and there was no designated Jewish Quarter. \n\nDuring the first half of the 19th century there were about 26 Jewish families living in the town. Though the community's institutions began to be established during the 18th century, the community was formally established in 1890, and included smaller communities in the surrounding area. The community regulations were formulated in 1896, which, among other things, laid out the terms of employment for a rabbi, an assistant to the rabbi, a cantor, and a melamed (teacher). \n\nRabbi Wolf Brunner was the rabbi of the community between 1825 and 1837. He was succeeded by Rabbi Abraham Ottiz, who served from 1865 until 1866. Among the community's leaders were Marjus Lweinski (1862-1879), Jacob Rotter (1879-1892), Alfred Bondi (1902-1908), and Alexander Fraenkel (1910-1921). \n\nThe first synagogue, which was built in 1777, was destroyed by a fire in 1807. It was reconstructed in 1847 and renovated again in 1868. A new synagogue with a garden was built in 1904. \n\nThe community supported a chevra kaddisha. In 1867 there was also a women's charity society. \n\nDuring the 18th century, and at the beginning of the 19th century, most of the town's Jews worked as traveling peddlers. A local brewery and distillery that produced beer, liquor, and vinegar was owned by a member of the Jewish community. Dobris also developed a glove manufacturing trade, and many Jews were involved in the production and trade of textiles. The Eisner family also owned a publishing house. During the second half of the19th century, after the emancipation of the Jews in the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1848 and the subsequent lifting of social and economic restrictions, many members of the community became physicians, teachers, lawyers, engineers, professors, and clerks. \n\nJews were also actively involved in local politics and were elected to the town's council and other local and regional institutions. They also demonstrated their patriotism throughout the wars that broke out during the 19th and 20th centuries. During the Napoleonic Wars of the 19th century young Jewish men from Dobris fought in the Kaiser's army. During World War I there were 69 Jewish men from Dobris who served in the army, some as officers. Six were killed in battle, and four were taken prisoner; a statue in memory of the fallen was established in the local cemetery. They also aided the many Jewish refugees from Poland that arrived in Dobris during World War I. After the war, Jews were granted cultural and national autonomy in the newly established Republic of Czechoslovakia. Jewish national consciousness began to be awakened, and a Zion Society was formed in Dobris. Emil Arenstein was elected as a member of the central committee of Zionist organizations during the First Zionist Conference of Czechoslovakia in 1919. That same year a delegate from the Jewish National List was elected to the town's council. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of September 1938, about a year before the outbreak of World War II, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was disbanded. Beginning in March 1939 Bohemia and Moravia were occupied by Nazi Germany and became a protectorate of the Third Reich, beginning a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews remaining in these regions. During a series of pogroms carried out by local fascists, the new synagogue was damaged. By the end of 1942 most of the Jews remaining in the protectorate had been concentrated in the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were deported to concentration and death camps, mostly in Poland, where most were killed. \n\nBefore the Jews of Dobris were deported to the Terezin Ghetto, 458 documents and 176 ritual objects belonging to the community were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nOnly 8 Jews from Dobris, including Petr Herrman, survived the war. Jewish life in the town was not revived. The building that once housed the new synagogue was converted into a cultural center that hosted concerts and exhibitions. The old synagogue was destroyed in 1960. \n  \n", "He": "\u05d3\u05d5\u05d1\u05d6'\u05d9\u05e9 Dobris\r\n\r\n\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8 \u05e0\u05e4\u05d4 \u05d1\u05de\u05e8\u05db\u05d6

Bohemia, Hradec Kralove Region, Rychnov nad Kneznou District, Czech Republic\n\nThe town of Dobruska was established before the beginning of the 14th century. It is located about 10 miles (16km) from the district town of Rychnov nad Kneznou. Until 1918 the region was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; after World War I and until 1933 it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe Museum of Dobruska contains a permanent exhibition dedicated to the history of the local Jewish community, and includes the mikvah (ritual bath) that was once used by the town's Jewish community. \n\nThe Jewish cemetery has been kept in good condition and hundreds of tombstones in Czech, Hebrew, and German, have remained standing in their original locations. In addition to the tombstones, there is also a memorial to the Jewish soldiers who fought in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. The cemetery is owned by the Jewish community of Prague. \n\nHISTORY\n\nJews are recorded as living in Dobruska during the first half of the 16th century. In 1618 four Jewish families are recorded as living in the town; 9 families were living in the town in 1666 and 1702. A Jewish Quarter was created in 1718 and shortly thereafter, in 1721, the bishop of Hradec Kralov demanded the expulsion of all Jews from Christian homes. This was counteracted by the local noblemen, who granted the Jews protection. \n\nOnce they were moved to the Jewish Quarter the Jewish community permitted to rent land for a synagogue. Later, the town of Dubroska was demolished during a fire in 1706. While the Jews of the town attempted to rebuild, they were denied permission to purchase plots of land and to build houses. The community escaped expulsion only due to the high rents that they paid to the town council. It was only in 1834 that the Jews were granted permission to purchase the homes in which they lived. Other restrictions were imposed on the Jews of the town, particularly in 1721. Among the restrictions was the prohibition against purchasing food and liquor anywhere other than Dobruska.\n\nIn 1848 Jews throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire were emancipated and the social, religious, and economic restrictions they were subjected to were gradually removed. Taking advantage of the removal of residence restrictions, the Jews of Dobruska built a new synagogue in Neo-Gothic style on the site where the old synagogue stood, east of Dobruska's central square. The cemetery, which was consecrated in 1675, was expanded in 1837. The cemetery eventually contained a mass grave of Jewish soldiers who died in a plague during the war between Austria and Prussia in 1866.\n\nMost of the Jews of Dobruska made their living as merchants and artisans. This continued into the 20th century, when most of the Jews of Dobruska were merchants, and some worked in industry. \n\nIn 1921 there were 148 Jews registered in the community, 40 of whom paid taxes. By 1930 that number had dropped to 39. On the eve of World War II there were 17 Jewish families living in Dobruska. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of September 1938, about a year before the outbreak of World War II, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was disbanded. Beginning in March 1939 Bohemia and Moravia were occupied by Nazi Germany and became a protectorate of the Third Reich, beginning a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews remaining in these regions. Beginning at the end of 1941 most of the Jews remaining in the protectorate had been concentrated in the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto; before their deportation, 105 ritual objects from the community of Dobruska were transferred from the synagogue to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. From there they were deported to concentration and death camps, mostly in Poland, where most were killed. \n  ", "He": "\u05d3\u05d5\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05e9\u05e7\u05d4

Bolikov is located approximately 12 miles (20km) from the district town of Jindrichuv Hradec. Until 1918 the region was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; after World War I and until 1933 it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe Jewish cemetery is owned by the Jewish community of Prague which pays for its continued maintenance. Hundreds of tombstones, in Hebrew and German, remain in their original locations. The founder of the newspaper \"Neues Wiener Tagblatt,\" Heinrich Mayer (1835-1905) is buried there.\n\nHISTORY\n\nIt is unclear when, exactly, Jews began to settle in Dolni Bolikov. It seems that a group of mostly poor Jews who had been expelled from Vienna arrived in the town in 1670. The first record of a Jewish persion at Dolni Bolikov is of Friedrich von Rosenthal in 1725; he inherited an estate from his father and offered it to his neighbor, Franz Anton, the count of Lichtenstein, who had authority over wide swaths of the region, including the towns of Telc and Slavonice. At that time other Jews leased the inn and seven houses in the village. A Jewish cemetery was consecrated in the 18th century. It is not known when the synagogue was built. \n\nThere were 14 Jewish families (68 people) living in Dolni Bolikov in 1763. During the first half of the 19th century another 25 Jewish families were granted permission to settle in the village. Most worked in trade, as peddlers, and in distilling spirits. \n\nIn 1822 a fire broke out and 23 Jewish homes were destroyed. They were eventually rebuilt, and in 1834 there were 26 Jewish homes standing in the Jewish Quarter. \n\nIn 1842 there were 165 Jews living in the village and 160 in 1848. That year Jews living in the Austro-Hungarian Empire were granted full civil rights. With the lifting of residence restrictions, many Jews throughout the region began to move to larger towns and cities in search of economic and educational opportunities. During this period the Jewish population of Dolni Bolikov gradually declined. In 1857 there were 135 Jews living in the village; by 1869 that number had dropped to 30 and by 1890 there were only three Jews remaining in the village. At that point the community was dissolved and in 1892 the three remaining Jews of Dolni Bolikov joined the community of Pisecne. \n\nThe dilapidated synagogue building was sold to a Christian and demolished in 1900.

Beginning in 2000 the synagogue was restored. The front wall includes a memorial plaque dedicated to the victims of the Holocaust. \n\nThe Jewish cemetery, which was founded in 1680, contains approximately 1,500 tombstones, some of which were moved from the medieval Jewish cemetery. The oldest tombstone dates to 1688. \n\nHISTORY\n\nJews began living in the town at the end of the 14th century.  During that period most Jews owned vineyards and wine presses. A Jewish judge is mentioned in 1581, indicating that by that point the community was well-established. In 1643 the synagogue was destroyed by Swedish troops during the Thirty Years' War. It was rebuilt and reconsecrated in 1652 and remained standing and functional for 280 years, until the Holocaust.\n\nAt the end of the 17th century several conventions of the Moravian communities were held in Dolni Kounice. In spite of the community's prominence, life in the Jewish Quarter would not be easy; the Jewish Quarter was destroyed by a fire in 1823, and by a flood in 1862. \n\nUntil residence restrictions were imposed in 1727, Jews were able to purchase land in the town. The new restrictions, however, limited the number of families who were able to live in the area. These restrictions were in place until the emancipation of the Austro-Hungarian Empire's Jews in 1848. That year there were 595 Jews living in Dolni Kounice. With the emancipation, however, and the subsequent removal of various residence and economic restrictions, Jews throughout the region began moving to larger towns and cities, in search of educational and economic opportunities. Dolni Kounice's Jewish population began to decline; by 1900 there were 206 Jews living in the town. By 1921 the population had dropped to 71 and in 1930 there were only 53 Jews (1.6% of the total population) remaining in Dolni Kounice, of whom 41 declared their nationality as Jewish. \n\nNotable people born in Dolni Kounice include the historian Gotthard Deutsch, as well as the historian Heinrich Flesch who was appointed as the town's rabbi in 1894.The Austrian chancellor Bruno Kreisky was also born in Dolni Kounice. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST \n\nThe Jews remaining in Dolni Kounice were deported to concentration and death camps in 1942. Ritual objects from the synagogue were sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague along with the chevra kaddisha's pinkas (minute-book).\n\nPOSTWAR\n\nThe community was not reestablished after World War II. The building that once housed the synagogue was used as a vegetable warehouse. \n", "He": "\u05d3\u05d5\u05dc\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e7\u05d5\u05d0\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05e6\u05d4 DOLNI

the Central Bohemian Region, Czech Republic\n\nDolni Kralovice is located about 50 miles (80km) from Prague. The town was founded during the 11th century and became an economic and cultural center. Until 1918 the region was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; after World War I and until 1933 it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe Jewish community of Dolni Kralovice was one of the oldest in the region. A synagogue was built around the 12th century and the Jewish cemetery was established around the 14th century (it would remain standing for approximately 600 years). The Jewish Street was located on the left bank of the river, in the western part of the town; many of the Jewish Quarter's buildings were destroyed in a fire in 1764, after which it was rebuilt. The residents of the Jewish street were required to wear a yellow patch on their clothing so that they could be identified as Jews, and rules were put into place restricting their residence, as well as the occupations that they were allowed to pursue. \n\nSome restrictions were lifted during the reign of Kaiser Joseph II (1780-1790). However, full civil rights were granted to the Jews of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1848. Until the emancipation the Jewish community of Dolni Kralovice had been fairly large, but following the emancipation, as more and more Jews moved to larger towns and cities in search of educational and economic opportunities, the population of Dolni Kralovice began to decline. Nonetheless, during the 1880s there were still over 50 Jewish families living in the village. \n\nThe community started maintaining a register in 1788, and records were written in the Czech language beginning in 1890. A German-language Jewish school was founded in 1864 and was recognized as a general school shortly thereafter. In 1876 it enrolled 91 students, among them 19 Christians. A new school building was built in 1882 and contained a library. During the 1890s the number of students enrolled in the school began to decrease, and in 1905 the school was closed down. Nonetheless, a new synagogue was built in 1906. \n\nAmong the community's leaders were Adolf Weiss, Jacob Cohen, Joseph Stein, Philip Weil, and Gustav Holzer.\n\nAt first, most of the region's Jews made their living as peddlers and petty traders, particularly in feathers and skins. Czech craftsmen's guilds were upset about the competition posed by the Jews, and their activities made it difficult for the Jews of Dolni Kralovice to prosper economically. Some of the wealthier Jews established agricultural farms or leased the estates of the nobility. After the emancipation, most Jews moved from agricultural areas to larger towns and cities. A number of small Jewish communities in the area, whose populations had dramatically decreased, began to affiliate with the community of Dolni Kralovice, which was the only remaining active community in the district. \n\nThe nearby villages of Kosetice, Lukavec, and Pravonin had a synagogue and a cemetery. In the village of Cechtice the prayer house was located in the home of the local ruler. 'When the Jews left the village, it was converted into a school room. In the village of Krivsoudov there was a Jewish community from the 18th until the 20th centuries, and in the village of Chmelna, where the grandfather of composer Gustav Mahler was born; the walls of the synagogue that was built during the 18th century are still standing.\n\nIn 1899 there was an outbreak of anti-Semitism throughout Bohemia following the Hilsner case, a blood libel in which a young Jewish man from the town of Polna was accused of murdering a Christian girl for ritual purposes. In Dolni Kralovice the townspeople and villagers from surrounding villages rioted for days and broke windows in Jewish homes and shops. The police forces that were summoned to the village found it difficult to restore law and order, even after imposing a curfew.\n\nIn 1921 there were 80 Jews living in the community; the chevra kaddisha and women's society were still functioning. By the early 1930s there were 41 Jews remaining in Dolni Kralovice, out of approximately 100 Jews still living in the region. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of September 1938, about a year before the outbreak of World War II, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was disbanded. Beginning in March 1939 Bohemia and Moravia were occupied by Nazi Germany and became a protectorate of the Third Reich, beginning a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews remaining in these regions. By the end of 1943 most of the Jews remaining in the protectorate had been concentrated in the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were deported to concentration and death camps, mostly in Poland, where most were killed. \n\nBefore the community of Dolni Kralovice was deported to Terezin, 17 of its ritual objects were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague.\n\nAfter World War II Jewish life was not renewed in Dolni Kralovice or the surrounding area. The New Jewish Cemetery in Prague includes a monument to the community of Dolni Kralovice. \n\nThe synagogue building was converted into a Czechoslovak Hussite church in 1951. In 1970 a dam was built, submerging the cemetery underwater. Ninety tombstones were moved to the Trhoby Stepanov cemetery. \n \n\n", "He": "\u05d3\u05d5\u05dc\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e7\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05e6\u05d4 Dolni

It was established during the mid-13th century. Until 1918 the region was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; after World War I and until 1933 it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. \n\nOne of the Torah scrolls from Domazlice was donated to Temple Beth Tikvah in Fullerton, CA in 1971, where it had remained on permanent loan. \n\nThe cemetery is owned by the Jewish community of Pilsen (Plzen), which funds its maintenance. Its borders have shrunk, due to some of its land being used to build a road. In addition to the remaining gravestones, the cemetery also contains a Holocaust memorial. \n\nHISTORY\n\nBetween the 14th century until the middle of the 19th century, when the Jews of the Austro-Hungarian Empire were emancipated, no more than 3 Jewish families were permitted to live in Domazlice. It was only after 1848, when the residence restrictions on Jews were lifted, that Jews from neighboring villages began settling in the town. \n\nDuring the 1860s a Jewish religious society was formed, and a cemetery was established; the religious society would eventually be recognized as the governing body of the organized community and the cemetery would be in use until 1941. A synagogue was built during the 1880s. \n\nIn 1921 there were 108 Jews living in Domazlice; by 1930 that number had dropped to 69. \n\nTHE HOLOCUAST\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of September 1938, about a year before the outbreak of World War II, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was disbanded and the Sudeten region came under Nazi control. Beginning in March 1939 Bohemia and Moravia were occupied by Nazi Germany and became a protectorate of the Third Reich, beginning a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews remaining in these regions. By the end of 1942 most of the Jews remaining in Domazlice had been concentrated in the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were deported to concentration and death camps, mostly in Poland, where most were killed. \n\nThe synagogue of Domazlice was destroyed by the Nazis. Before the Jews of the town were deported to Terezin, 20 documents and 461 ritual objects were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. \n", "He":

miles (98km) east of Prague. Until 1918 the region was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; after World War I and until 1933 it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe cemetery, which is owned by the Jewish community of Prague, is located in a small patch of woods on a hill named Radobylka, approximately 1 mile (1km) from the village. The oldest remaining tombstone dates to 1681 and approximately 300 tombstones are still standing. The pre-burial house and tahara (ritual purification table) were reconstructed and repaired and can also be found within the cemetery.  \n\nHISTORY\n\nIt is unclear when, precisely, Jews began living n Drazkov. A record dating from the middle of the 18th century indicates that there were six Jewish families living in the village, and that there was a prayer room and a cantor. By the middle of the 19th century there was an organized community of 20 Jewish families in Drazkov. In 1862 the community built a synagogue on the east side of the village, along the road leading to the village of Skrysov. Services were held there until 1932.\n\nDuring the second half of the 19th century, following the 1848 emancipation of the Jews throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Jews living in more rural areas began migrating to larger towns and cities, seeking new and diverse educational and economic opportunities. Indeed, by 1932 there were only 2 Jews left living in Drazkov. Jewish community life continued to exist in some neighboring villages and small towns. Zduchovicce, Hrimezdice (formerly Vermerice) and Klucenice maintained active prayer rooms since the 19th century. Kamyk nad Voltavou (German: Kamaik), Smolotely, Trebnice, Petrovice, and Bohostice maintained minyans through the 20th century. Bohostice also had a cemetery with tombstones dating back to the 18th century. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of September 1938, about a year before the outbreak of World War II, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was disbanded. Beginning in March 1939 Bohemia and Moravia were occupied by Nazi Germany and became a protectorate of the Third Reich, beginning a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews remaining in these regions. By the end of 1942 most of the Jews remaining in the protectorate, including those from Drazkov, had been concentrated in the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were deported to concentration and death camps, mostly in Poland, where most were killed. \n\nJewish life was not removed in Drazkov or any of the neighboring villages after the war.

approximately 64 miles (104km) southeast of Prague and about 4 miles (6km) south of the district town of Chrudim. Since 1960 Drevikov has been part of the village Vysocina. Until 1918 the region was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; after World War I and until 1933 it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe cemetery, which is owned by the Jewish community of Prague, is located less than a mile (500 meters) from the village and also includes a pre-burial house. \n\nHISTORY\n\nJews arrived to live in Drevikov during the middle of the 18th century, and soon became the majority of the village's residents. The Jewish Street was located east of the village's central square and the synagogue, which was built during the middle of the 18th century and renovated during the 19th century, stood at the eastern end of the street. A cemetery was founded during the 18th century and expanded during the second half of the 19th century. Most of the Jews of Drevikov's Jews worked as merchants. \n\nFollowing the emancipation of Jews throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1848, and the subsequent removal of residence and economic restrictions, many of those who lived in more rural areas began moving to larger towns and cities, seeking more educational and economic opportunities. Indeed, by the end of the 19th century only 20 Jews were living in Drevikov. By 1930 there were no longer any Jews living in the village; the last Jewish family left in 1910. \n\nThe Jewish community of Hlinsko, a small town located about 3 miles (5km) from Drevikov, was the closest Jewish community to Drevikov. A Jewish cemetery was established there at the end of the 19th century, and a synagogue was built in 1904. After World War II the synagogue in Hlinsko was converted into a municipal museum. Thirty-four of the cemetery's tombstones have been preserved.

Until 1918 the region was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; after World War I and until 1933 it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia.\n\nJews are mentioned in Duchcov at the turn of the 14th century. However, evidence points to the fact that they were expelled from the town sometime before 1527, and not allowed to resettle until after 1848, when Jews throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire were emancipating, and residence restrictions began to be removed. The Jewish community that subsequently arose in Duchcov was affiliated with the community of Templice-Sanov, where there was a synagogue and a cemetery; Duchcov itself did not have its own synagogue. \n\nAt its peak, in 1921, there were 233 Jews living in the area of Duchcov, 134 of whom lived in the town itself. \n\nBetween the two World Wars Zionism became popular in Duchcov. Before the elections to the 15th Zionist Congress in 1927 the Jews of Duchcov purchased membership and voting rights, a trend that continued in subsequent years. \n\nBy 1930 there were 168 Jews living in the area of Duchcov, 111 of whom lived in the town itself. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of September 1938, about a year before the outbreak of World War II, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was disbanded and Sudetenland was annexed to Nazi Germany. Many Jews living in the region left for Bohemia and Moravia however, beginning in March 1939 Bohemia and Moravia were occupied by Nazi Germany and became a protectorate of the Third Reich. This began a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews remaining in these regions. By the end of 1942 most of the Jews remaining in the protectorate had been concentrated in the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were deported to concentration and death camps, mostly in Poland, where most were killed. \n\n\n\n", "He": "\u05d3\u05d5\u05db\u05e6\u05d5\u05d1

In 2008 Temple Sholom and Dvur Kralove worked together to erect the Monument to the Murdered Jewish Citizens of Dvur Kralove nad Labem where the town's synagogue once stood. \n\nOne of the town's best-known attractions in Dvur Kralove is the zoo, which was originally part of a private park owned by Jewish factory owner Richard Neumann. The Nazis seized his land, the Soviets subsequently nationalized it, and the zoo was opened to the public in 1946. \n\nThe area where the Jewish cemetery was once located was destroyed during 1959-1960. The tombstones were removed, and the walls and buildings were demolished. The site is currently a park containing fragments of tombstones, as well as a memorial stone. \n\nHISTORY\n\nAs a royal town, Dvur Kralove took advantage of its right to forbid Jewish settlement within its borders (\"Privilegium de non Tolerandis Judaeis\"). Jews are first mentioned in the town in 1838, and free Jewish settlement within Dvur Kralove became possible only after Austro-Hungarian Jewry was emancipated in 1848 and residence restrictions were lifted. The first Jews who came to live in Dvur Kralove were from the neighboring towns of Velka and Horice, where Jews had been living since the 17th century. \n\nA Jewish community, consisting of 11 men and 12 women, was organized in 1873 as a cultural society. They dedicated a prayer room in a rented house, where they also opened a school and hired a teacher. A cemetery was founded in 1883; until then, the Jews of Dvur Kralove were buried in Velka or Horice. The synagogue was established in 1891. \n\nThe first Jews to arrive in Dvur Kralove were merchants who were permitted to sell salt and tobacco. Later the Jews developed a local textile industry, and many became involved in the production, dying, and printing of cloth. By 1861 two Jews had set up a small factory for processing wool, which eventually grew and employed 150 workers. Jews also established small workshops for making jewelry and polishing pearls. \n\nThe Jewish community was also well-integrated into the social and cultural life of the town. Three of the teachers in the municipal high school were Jewish. Dr. Ernest Back and the manufacturer Otto Schlein supported municipal institutions for children and youth. Otto Mayer was the chairman of the Democratic German Culture Party. \n\nThe Jewish population increased rapidly at the end of the 19th century. The population peaked in 1910, with 232 people (2.2% of the total population). \n\nRabbis of the community included Rabbi Emanuel Polak (1898-1923), Rabbi Dr. Gustav Ziecher (1924-1928), Rabbi Dr. Moritz Mandel (1929-1934), and Rabbi Dr. Emil Friedman (1934-1939). The leaders of the community included Dr. Ernest Back, Ludwig Krug, Rudolf Kohn, and Walter Pick.\n\nAfter World War I the community's population declined significantly, a result of both emigration and assimilation. In 1927 there were only 6 school-age children in the community. \n\nWhile many of the Jews in Dvur Kralove were proponents of German culture, some grew up with Czech culture; after the establishment of the Republic of Czechoslovakia in 1918, more Jews declared themselves as Czech Nationals. A Jewish manufacturer who supported the Czechs formed a welfare organization and donated money in order to repair the high school. In 1930 the municipality erected a statue in honor of the Jewish sculptor and art professor Otto Gutfreund, a native of the town. \n\nAdditionally, during the interwar period the community became proponents of Jewish nationalism. Before the 15th Zionist Congress the Jews of Dvur Kralove purchased membership and voting rights. For the 1930 census 35 of the 182 Jews (19.3%) declared their nationality as Jewish. \n\nIn 1939, of the 106 Jews working in the town, 24 were homeowners. Among those who declared their profession, twenty-one worked as merchants, 14 as craftsmen, 14 as clearks, 7 as managers in banks and factories, 7 as engineers and technicians, 4 as physicians, 3 as lawyers, and one as a teacher. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of 1938 the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved. The Sudeten region was annexed to Germany, and some Jews escaping from the area arrived in Dvur Kralove. \n\nIn March of 1939 the regions of Bohemia and Moravia became part of the protectorate of the Third Reich, beginning a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews of the region. \n\nNinety-two Jews from Dvur Kralove were deported on December 17, 1942 via the city of Hradec Kralove, to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. The rest of the Jews were deported shortly thereafter. From Terezin they were sent to concentration and death camps, mainly in Poland, where most were killed. Before the deportations, 110 ritual objects belonging to the community of Dvur Kralove, including a Torah scroll, were transferred to the Jewish Museum in Prague. \n\nJews did not return to Dvur Kralove after the war. The synagogue, which was not destroyed during the war, was used as an archive before being demolished in 1966 by Soviet authorities to make room for a highway. The cemetery was also destroyed in 1959. For a long time the only remaining trace of Jewish life in the town was a memorial plaque at the local high school for the teachers who died between 1938 and 1945. \n\n", "He":

Made up of the two formerly independent towns of Frydek and Mistek, which are divided by the Ostravice River. Frydek was originally established during the 14th century on the right back of the Ostravice, while Mistek was established in 1267 on the left bank. Until 1918 the region was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After World War I and until 1993 (aside from a brief interruption during World War II), it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. \n\nThe Torah scroll from the Jewish community of Frydek Mistek, which was sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague during World War II, has been on permanent loan to Congregation Beth Israel in Charlottesville, Virginia since 1999. \n\nThe Jewish cemetery of Frydek-Mistek is owned and supported by the Ostrava Jewish Congregation. The tombstones have inscriptions in German, Hebrew, and Czech and also includes a pre-burial house. The cemetery was vandalized in 1997 and 80 of the approximately 200 tombstones were broken.\n\nHISTORY \n\nJews were permitted to settle in Frydek-Mistek only after the emancipation of Austro-Hungarian Jews in 1848 and the subsequent repeal of residence restrictions. Until then only 119 Jewish families were permitted to live in the entirety of Eastern Silesia, and in order to restrict their numbers no marriage licenses had been issued to the young adults of those families. With some exceptions, until 1848 most of the Jews in the area lived in the villages of Kolloredov and Swiadnow. \n\nThe village of Kolloredov, where the prayer room was located, eventually became the center of Mistek, after which the prayer room expanded and moved to a rented house, before moving to a wooden building on the right back of the river. For many years Isak Fried served as the cantor and shochet (ritual slaughterer). The synagogue had its own book of regulations, written mostly in German with some Hebrew. At first only 28 of the city's Jews lived in the community and maintained the synagogue, communal institutions, and charitable societies. The community was officially organized in 1861, at which point it elected a community committee, led by Ignaz Munk. Protocols were adopted and tax collection was regulated. In 1863 the community was recognized by the Silesian authorities as affiliated with the community of Tesin.\n\nThe synagogue was built in Frydek on land donated by Archduke Albrecht of Tesin (German: Teschen), who also helped finance the project. In return, the community placed a plaque thanking the archduke at the synagogue's entrance. The synagogue was consecrated just before Rosh Hashana, in September 1865. In 1893 the building was refurbished and an organ was installed. This synagogue, as well as other communal institutions, would serve Frydek, Mistek, and Kolloredov. \n\nQuestions of Jewish law were referred to the rabbi of Tesin, where the Jews of Frydek and Mistek would also bury their dead. The community was granted permission to establish their own cemetery in 1882. This cemetery, which was built in Mistek, also contained a purification room, as well as a home for the caretaker. \n\nIn 1890 the Jewish community of Frydek-Mistek separated from the community of Tesin and was recognized as an autonomous community. Its regulations were submitted to the authorities for approval in 1893 and were accepted in 1896. Among the community's institutions were a chevra kaddisha and a women's society. The community then received approval for a Jewish school in 1870 and building began in 1898; the school eventually opened in 1900, along with a community house. The community house contained a meeting hall, offices, as well as homes for the first rabbi of the community, Rabbi Dr. Yehuda Bergmann, and the school caretaker. The school functioned until the end of the 1930s. \n\nJews were heavily involved in the manufacturing industry, though others were worked in distillery, the flour mill, and in trade. \n\nAfter World War I, with the establishment of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, the Jews were recognized as a national minority. In addition to becoming active in local politics, the Jews of Frydek-Mistek also became involved in Zionism. In 1926, before the 15th Zionist Congress, the Jews of Frytek-Mistek purchased membership and voting rights. In 1937 twenty-four of the town's Jews took part in the elections to the 20th Zionist Congress. \n\nIn 1921 there were 960 Jews living in the community. However, many began leaving for larger towns and cities and the population gradually began to decline. By 1930 there were 368 Jews living in Frydek-Mistek. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of September 1938, which forced the Republic of Czechoslovakia to annex the Sudeten Region to Germany, the Republic was dissolved. In 1939 the Germans occupied the regions of Bohemia and Moravia, which became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, beginning an era of discrimination and violence against the Jews. By the end of 1942 most of the Jews in the region were concentrated in the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto, from which they were deported to concentration and death camps, mostly in Poland, where most were killed. \n\nThe Nazis destroyed the synagogue in Frydek-Mistek in 1939. Before the Jews of Frydek-Mistek were deported to Terezin, 15 documents, 12 books, and 176 ritual objects belonging to the community, including a Torah scroll, were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nJewish life in Frydek-Mistek was not revived after the war, though burials continued to take place in the Jewish cemetery.

District, Vysocina Region, Czech Republic\n\nIn May, 2012, a Torah scroll from Golcuv Jenikov, which had been transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague during World War II, was acquired by the Gishrei Shalom Jewish Congregation in Southington, Connecticut. \n\nMost of Golcuv Jenikov's Jewish Quarter has survived. Remains of the mikvah (ritual bath) can be found in the basement of the former school. Other formerly Jewish homes that have remained standing include the former rabbi's house, as well as a prayer room. Additionally, the synagogue is still standing in the center of the Jewish Quarter. After the war it was converted into a Hussite Church and a Czech Brethren's Protestant Church. Since 1977 it has been under the auspices of the Jewish Museum in Prague.  \n\nThe Jewish cemetery contains over 1,000 tombstones, as well as a mortuary and ceremony hall. It is owned and maintained by the Jewish community of Prague.\n\nHISTORY \n\nJews most probably settled in Golcuv Jenikov at the end of the 16th century. Documents indicate that by 1659 there was a synagogue in the town, which would be refurbished in 1806 and 1870. The community maintained a Jewish school, in which the language of instruction was German, from 1797 until 1907. \n\nRabbi Aaron Kornfeld, the last rosh yeshiva of Bohemia, lived in Golcuv Jenikov; Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise was among the students of his yeshiva and Sir Moses Montefiore visited the yeshiva in 1842. Other notable figures who were born or lived in the town include the rabbis Jonathan HaLevi Altar and Meir HaLevi Altar. \n\nIn 1724 there were 28 Jewish families living in Golcuv Jenikov and in 1847 there were 613 Jews living in the town (27.8% of the total population). By 1931 that number had dropped to 79 (3.9%) as Jews throughout the region  sought opportunities in larger towns and cities. \n\nThe nearby community of Habry (Habern) had a Jewish community that was founded during the 14th century and which was incorporated into the Jewish community of Golcuv Jenikov in 1898. There were 21 Jewish families living in Habry in 1724 and 120 families living in the town in 1848. By 1893 there were 143 Jews living in Habry, and 79 people living in the town in 1930.  \n\nThe members of the community who had not left by 1942 were deported to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto, from which they were sent to concentration and death camps. Ritual objects from the synagogue, including a Torah scroll, were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. \n\n", "He": "\u05d2\u05d5\u05dc\u05e6'\u05d5\u05d1

Vienna, approximately 4 miles (7km) from the town of Golcuv Jenikov. Until 1918 the region was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Between the two World Wars, and from the end of World War II until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe Jewish cemetery of Habry is owned by the Jewish community of Prague. Many of the tombstones are broken or not in their original locations. The cemetery also includes the remains of the pre-burial house. \n\nHISTORY \n\nA few \"protected Jews\" (those who were not subject to residence restrictions) had lived in Habry since the 14th century. A Jewish cemetery was established around the year 1650; the community rented the land for the cemetery until 1746, when they were granted ownership of it. The community had its own chevra kaddisha. \n\nA community register was kept at Harby beginning in the year 1770. The synagogue was built in 1825 and renovated in 1893. The interior furniture for the synagogue was donated by Karl Lustig. \n\nAn elementary Jewish school had three classes and operated until 1870. The language of instruction was German. As for the adults, at first most of the Jews of Habry were merchants and craftsmen. After the emancipation in 1848 more began working as professionals, and to take part in the public and political life of the town. \n\nIn 1848 there were about 120 Jewish families living in Habry. That year Jews throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire were granted full civil rights and residence restrictions were lifted. This prompted Jews throughout the empire to move to bigger towns and cities, seeking greater educational and economic opportunities. Habry was no exception to this trend. In 1893 there were 143 Jews living in Habry, but in 1921 there were only 74 Jews registered in the community. By the 1930s only 28 Jews remained in Habry. \n\nAmong the rabbis of Harby were Rabbi Joseph Kohn (1799-1808), Rabbi Tobias Gruenhut (1813-1840), Rabbi Zechariah Spitz (1858-1884) and Rabbi Alois Taussig (1913-1920). Among the leaders of the community were Dr. Jacob Kraus (1870-1880), Dr. Aaron Lengsfeld (1880-1913), Karl Lustig (1913-1923), Dr. Ignaz Klauber (1923-1929), and again Karl Lustig, who served until the 1930s. \n\nDuring World War I, 4 members of the community were killed in battle. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nThe Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved after the Munich Agreement of September 1938. In 1939 the regions of Bohemia and Moravia became protectorates of the German Third Reich, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the region's Jews. By the end of 1942 most of the Jews of the region were concentrated in Terezin (Theresienstadt), from which they were deported to concentration and death camps.\n\nPOSTWAR\n\nJewish life was not renewed in Habry after the war.

Due to the community's lack of funds, it was put on the market and changed hands a number of times until 2002, when it was purchased by Michal Klima, who establishedthe Hartmanice Memorial. Beginning in 2004 the badly-damaged synagogue was refurbished and on May 16th, 2006, the newly-reconstructed synagogue was inaugurated by Petr Pithard, the vice president of the Czech Senate, and Karol Ephraim Sidon, the chief rabbi of the Czech Republic. The synagogue was designated as a national historic landmark in 2006. It is open to visitors and offers guided tours. \n\nThe only surviving tombstone from the Jewish cemetery of Hartmanice was moved and can be found in front of the restored synagogue.\n\nHISTORY\n\nJews were prohibited from living in Hartmanice until after 1848, when Jews throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire were granted full civil and religious rights and the various restrictions that had been placed on them began to be repealed. \n\nAt the end of the 19th century there were approximately 120 Jews living in the town (13% of the town's total population). The communities of Hartmanice and the nearby village of Kundratice founded a cemetery in 1870, which served both communities for 70 years. In 1881 the communities of Hartmanice and Kundratice built a synagogue that would serve the growing community of Hartmanice, as well as the smaller Jewish settlements in the area. A small house connected to the synagogue building was used to house the rabbi and as a Jewish school. By 1884 about 200 Jews were attending services at the new synagogue and it became the center of the community. Jews also took an active and important role in the development of local businesses. They dealt in grain, livestock, and furs, owned the local bar, as well as a glass and tinfoil factory. \n\nBy the 1920s, however, many of the Jews of Hartmanice had moved to larger towns and cities, in search of more educational and economic opportunities. By the 1930s there were only 21 Jews left in the town, 5 of whom declared their nationality as Jewish. As a result of this population decline, the area's Jewish center was moved to the town of Susice. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nAfter the Nazi occupation in 1938, most of the area's Jews fled to regions in Bohemia and Moravia in the interior of Czechoslovakia. However, beginning in March 1939 Bohemia and Moravia were occupied by Nazi Germany and became a protectorate of the Third Reich, beginning a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews remaining in these regions. By the end of 1941 most of the Jews remaining in Hartmanice and the area had been concentrated in the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were deported to concentration and death camps, mostly in Poland, where most were killed.\n\nIn 1945, just before the end of the war, a death march of 500 Jewish women from the concentration camp of Helmbrechts (a subcamp of the Flossenburg concentration camp) passed through Hartmanice on their way to the concentration camp in Volary. Twelve women died along the way and were buried in the Jewish cemetery. \n", "He": ""}, "UnitText2": {"En": "", "He": ""}, "UnitPlaces": [], "DisplayStatusDesc": "Museum only", "UnitHeaderDMSoundex": {"En": "ZZ E593665 E593664 ZZ ", "He": "ZZ H593664 ZZ "}, "UnitDisplayStatus": 2, "RightsCode": 1, "UnitId": 161128, "IsValueUnit": true, "StatusDesc": "Completed", "PlaceParentTypeCodeDesc": {"En": "Region"}, "PlaceParentId": 67981, "UserLexicon": null, "Attachments": [], "geometry": null, "Slug": {"En": "place_hartmanice", "He": "\u05de\u05e7\u05d5\u05dd_\u05d4\u05e8\u05d8\u05de\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9\u05e1"}, "Header": {"En": "Hartmanice", "He": "\u05d4\u05e8\u05d8\u05de\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9\u05e1"}, "ForPreview": false, "_id": "161128"}, {"LocationInMuseum": null, "Pictures": [], "PictureUnitsIds": null, "related": [], "UpdateDate": "2016-03-30 16:59:00", "OldUnitId": "HB068742.HTM-EB068591.HTM", "id": 192828, "UpdateUser": "administrator", "PrevPictureFileNames": null, "PrevPicturePaths": null, "PlaceTypeCode": 2, "TS": "0000000000521ab0", "PlaceTypeDesc": {"En": "Town", "He": "\u05e2\u05d9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4"}, "UnitType": 5, "UnitTypeDesc": "Place", "EditorRemarks": "hasavot from Places ", "UnitStatus": 3, "RightsDesc": "Full", "Bibiliography": {"En": "List, Miriam Hajnal\n\nhttp://www.iajgsjewishcemeteryproject.org/czech-republic/hluboka-nad-vltavou.html", "He": "\u05de\u05e7\u05d5\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea, \u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05d9\u05d9\u05e0\u05dc"}, "UnitText1": {"En": "Hluboka nad Vlatvou\n\n\nUntil 1912 known as Podhradi\nGerman: Frauenberg\n\nA town in the South Bohemian Region, Czech Republic\n\nHluboka was founded during the 15th century and is located about 6 miles (9km) north of the district town of Ceske Budejovice. Until 1918 the region was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Between the two World Wars, and between the end of World War II until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. \n\nThe Jewish cemetery, which is still accessible, is located near the Munice Pond (Municky Rybnik). Restoration work took place during the 1990s and in 2009. The City of Hluboka is responsible for maintaining the cemetery.\n\nHISTORY\n\nThe first Jewish families arrived in Hluboka during the middle of the 17th century; by the end of the century the town was home to a large Jewish community. The community began organizing in 1752 and its regulations were officially approved in 1785. The prayer house, cemetery (which was active between 1750 and 1941), and the chevra kaddisha of Hluboka also served Jews living in the neighboring villages. \n\nThe Jewish Street, which eventually became known as Tyrsova Street, was located southwest of the town square. The mikveh, a Jewish school, and a synagogue (built in 1907) were located there. The town's Jews spoke Czech, and most worked as traders.\n\nIn 1848 Jews throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire were granted full civil rights. Settlement restrictions were removed, and many Jews in rural areas began moving to larger towns and cities, in search of greater economic and educational opportunities. Hluboka was no exception to this trend; during the first half of the 19th century there were approximately 130 Jews living in Hluboka, but by 1893 that number had dropped to 80. In 1921, when Hink Huller and Joseph Huller led the community, there were only 25 Jews left in the town. \n\nProfessor Dr. Karl Thieberger was among the rabbis who led the community of Hluboka. Leopold Schleissner was the community's cantor. Eduard Bloch, the physician for Adolf Hitler's family, was born in Hluboka.  \n\nIn 1930 there were 20 Jews living in Hluboka.\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nThe Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved after the Munich Agreement of September 1938. Shortly thereafter, in March 1939, the regions of Bohemia and Moravia became protectorates of Nazi Germany, initiating a period of discrimination and violence against the areas' Jews. \n\nThe Jews of Hluboka and the surrounding areas were sent to Terezin (Theresienstadt) around April, 1942. From there they were deported to concentration and death camps. Before their deportation to Terezin, six books and 105 ritual objects from the community were sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague.

Goeding\n\nA town in the South Moravian Region, Czech Republic\n\nHodonin's two Jewish cemeteries are owned by the Jewish community of Brno, which funds a caretaker for their maintenance. The cemetery also contains a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust. \n\nHISTORY\n\nA Jewish community is mentioned in 1648 as having existed \"for many years\" and indeed, it appears that Hodonin was a particularly well-established community. By 1682 the town had two Jewish cemeteries, and by 1688 the Jewish Quarter, which was located on an island in the Morava (March) River, contained 30 houses and a synagogue. The Jews tended to work as vintners, and owned vineyards and wine cellars. \n\nIn 1773 there were 415 people in the Jewish community, but in 1774 they were expelled from the town by Maria Theresa. Twenty Jews from Hodonin went on to found the community of Kostelec, near Kyjov. Later, Joseph II allowed 13 families to resettle in Hodonin.\n\nIn 1836 there were 109 Jews living in the town. After the emancipation of Jews throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1848, residence restrictions that had affected the Jews were lifted. And so, in 1853 the number of Jews living in Hodonin rose to 215. In 1869 there were 433 Jews living in the town, and at its peak, in 1900, there were 976 Jews living in Hodonin. As a result of emigration the population began to drop during the 20th century; in 1921 there were 797 Jews living in the town, and in 1930 the Jewish population was 670 (4.5% of the total population). \n\nIn 1921, the community advertised a position for a rabbi. In the advertisement, they required that applicants be Czechoslovak citizens, have a doctorate, and speak German and Czech. Being able to provide a religious education in the state language, Czech, was emphasized as being particularly important to the community. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nThe Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved after the Munich Agreement of September 1938. Shortly thereafter, in March 1939, the regions of Bohemia and Moravia became protectorates of Nazi Germany, beginning a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews. \n\nThe Jews of Hodonin were deported to concentration camps by the end of 1942. Before their deportation, many ritual objects from the synagogue of Hodonin were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. During the war, a concentration camp in Hodonin imprisoned Romani people from the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nIn 1970 there was a small community in Hodonin affiliated with Kyjov, but by the 21st century there were virtually no Jews remaining in Hodonin. The Austrian politician, Joseph Redlich, was born in Hodonin. \n", "He": "\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05df HODONIN\r\n\r\n(\u05d1\u05d2\u05e8\u05de\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea

of the Carpathian Mountains, Czech Republic\n\nHolesov was originally a village, and was first mentioned in 1030 under the name Gulesi an der Ruza. The village was destroyed in 1241 by the Mongols but rebuilt; in 1271 it was renamed Holesov and given the status of town. Until 1918 the region was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; between the two World Wars, and between the end of World War II and 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. \n\nThe Old Synagogue, more commonly known as the Sach Synagogue, is the only Polish-style synagogues to have been preserved; indeed, the synagogue is remarkably beautiful.  The women's section now houses a museum exhibit titled \"Moravia and the Jews.\" Additionally, of the 103 houses that once stood at the Jewish Quarter 45 have been preserved, including what was once the school, a beit midrash, and a hospital. \n\nThe Jewish cemetery, containing over 1,500 graves, can still be visited. Of particular note is the tomb of Rabbi Shabbetai ben Meir HaCohen, better known as the Sach, whose grave is visited by Jews from all over the world. A house of mourning in the cemetery also contains a memorial which lists the names of the 253 Jews from Holesov who were killed during the Holocaust. \n\nThe town hosts an annual festival called Jewish Culture Week during the month of August. \n\nHISTORY\n\nThere are records of Jews living in Holesov dating from 1391, but a sustained community was apparently only established after 1454, when the Jews of the free royal town of Olomouc were expelled and came to Holesov. At that time the region was ruled by the Hussites (members of the revolutionary Czech national and social movement, named after its founder Jan Hus), and the Jews were accepted and allowed to live there. The community would also later receive Jews who were expelled from Uherske Hradiste in 1514. \n\nIn 1540 most of the town's houses were destroyed by a fire, which also destroyed documents recording Jewish life in the community. In 1622 the town was occupied by the Hungarian army, followed in 1643 by the Swedish army. At that point the Jews were living in the town under the protection of local nobles. They paid special protection taxes, but they were exempt from other local taxes and the Christian locals were not allowed to harass them. However, ownership of the town often changed hands, and each time the Jews were required to renew their residence rights. A letter of rights that was granted to the Jews of Holesov in 1651 allowed them to build 5 homes inside the town and an additional 41 homes near it, a small beit midrash, a community house, a hospital, and a mikvah. They were also allowed to establish a cemetery, to live openly as Jews, and to choose their own leaders.\n\nThe old synagogue, also known as the Sach Synagogue, was built in 1560 in Renaissance style. Jewish immigrants from Poland had a large role in renovating the synagogue in 1737, giving it a unique style. \n\nA convention of representatives of the Jews of Moravia was held in Holesov in 1653, where the 311 regulations that established the Jews of Moravia as an autonomous body were expanded. \n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries most of the Jews of Holesov worked as merchants, dealing in cloth, skins, wool, and cotton. Others were merchants who dealt in poultry and geese. The Jewish craftsmen worked mostly as tailors and tanners. Some of the Jewish merchants of Holesov participated in the larger fairs of Breslau and Leipzig. During the second half of the 17th century, however, the community experienced a number of economic hardships. During the war with Prussia, in 1742, Queen Maria Theresa imposed heavy taxes on the Jews in anticipation of eventually expelling them from Moravia, which resulted in the community of Holesov, which at that time had a population of 1,500, going into debt. As a result, the synagogue building and the silver ornaments within it were seized, and the community's leaders were jailed. Shortly thereafter, in 1745, a fire broke out and about a third of the Jewish Quarter was destroyed. Years later the community was still struggling to repay its debts. Additionally, residence restrictions were put into place, limiting the number of Jews who could live in Holesov. As a result, in 1720 a number of Jews from Holesov founded the community of Liptovsky Milulas; nonetheless, this community was still under the auspices of the community in Holesov and High Holiday services for both communities were held in Holesov. \n\nIn 1748 the Jewish population of Holesov was 1,032 (194 families), who occupied 49 of the town's houses. In 1831 the population rose to 1,316. By 1869 Holesov's Jewish population was 1,764 (about 25% of the total population). \n\nAfter the emancipation of Austro-Hungarian Jews in 1848, and the subsequent lifting of economic and residence restrictions, Jews began to expand their economic activities. A furniture factory and a distillery were established in Holesov, both by Jews. Additionally, the community was granted the status of a political community with municipal autonomy. The Jewish Quarter functioned independently, with its own mayor-like figure, a police force, firefighters, and night watchmen. In 1883 the religious community was separated from the political community, and in 1919 the Jewish part of town was united with the Christian town. \n\nA new synagogue was built in Holesov in 1893, which also contained a beit midrash. \n\nThe first rabbi to serve the community was Rabbi Menahem Mendel, who worked in Holsesov during the first half of the 17th century. The famous Rabbi Shabbetai, ben Meir HaCohen, served between 1662 and 1668. Other notable figures from Holesov include the historian Gershon Wolf and Rabbi Johanan ben Isaac, who served as the Ashkenazi rabbi of London at the beginning of the 18th century.  \n\nJewish life in Holesov was not always easy. In 1682 the local bishop prohibited the town's Jews from being present in the town square during Christian processions. However, in 1774 a group of Catholic clergy protected a Jewish family from a mob that had formed after a Christian woman was killed in the family's home. In 1899, following a dispute between Czechs and Germans, a pogrom broke out in the Jewish Quarter that lasted three days; the Czechs accused the Jews of spreading German culture. In the end, the military was required to intervene in order to quell the riots, and the remained guarding the Jews and their property for six months. In spite of this protection, however, many Jews left the town and in 1914 the Jewish population in Holesov dropped to 1,200. On December 4, 1918, about 200 armed men attacked the local Jews, killing two Jewish soldiers who had recently returned from the war, and looted Jewish homes and shops. This pogrom also caused many Jews to leave; by 1930 there were only 273 Jews remaining in Holesov, 4% of the town's total population. \n \nThe Jews who remained in the town after the establishment of the Republic of Czechoslovakia became active in Jewish politics, as well as in the political life of the town. In 1919 three delegates from the Jewish party were elected to the town's council. Zionism became influential, and in 1926 the community purchased membership and voting rights to the Zionist Congress.\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nThe Munich Agreement of September 1938 dissolved the Republic of Czechoslovakia and gave the Sudeten Region to Germany. By March, 1939 the region of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews living there. By the end of 1942 most of the Jews in the protectorate had been concentrated in Terezin (Theresienstadt), before being deported to concentration and death camps, where most were killed. Approximately 200 Jewish families from Holesov and the surrounding area were deported. Before their deportation 282 ritual objects, 274 books, and 5,011 documents from the community were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. The New Synagogue was destroyed. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nSurvivors from the community returned to the town after the war, and the community became affiliated with the community of Kyjob. In 1948 there were 37 Jews living in Holesov, 23 of whom were registered officially as part of the community.  \n\nIn 1960 the Jewish Quarter was repaired, and a museum documenting the life of the Jews of Moravia was established on the second floor of the old synagogue. The community repaired and cleaned the cemetery, which included the grave of Rabbi Shabbetai ben Meir HaCohen, and added a memorial plaque to the victims of the Holocaust. It was also during the 1960s that the community ceased to be autonomous, and was merged with the Jewish community of Brno.     \n", "He": "\u05d4\u05d5\u05dc\u05e9\u05d5\u05d1

Republic\n\nHorazdovice was founded at the end of the 13th century. Until 1918 the region was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Between the two World Wars, and between the end of World War II and 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia.\n\nTen Torah scrolls were transferred from Horazdovice to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague during World War II. One is displayed in the foyer of Temple Emanuel of Greater New Haven, Connecticut. Another Torah from Horazdovice has been on permanent loan to Westminster Synagogue in London since 1968. The other Torah scrolls from Horazdovice can be found in Congregation Ezrath Israel in Ellenville, New York, Park Avenue Synagogue in Manhattan, Temple Sinai of Dresher in Dresher, Pennsylvania, Temple Kol Emeth in Palo Alto, California, Temple Beth Ora in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, B'nai Israel Congregation in Wilmington, South Carolina, the Young Israel of Hollywood in Hollywood, Florida, and the Ministry of Religious Affairs in Jerusalem, Israel. \n\nThe synagogue in Slatina (one of the communities affiliated with Horazdovice) was renovated in 1983 and has been registered as a national monument since 1988. Over 100 tombstones in the cemetery of Slatina have been preserved; the oldest legible tombstone dates to the 18th century. \n\nHISTORY\n\nIt is likely that Jews lived in Horazdovice since the town's founding, but records of their presence in the town date from the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). In 1619 the Jews were granted land for a cemetery in the eastern part of the town. At that time only 10 Jewish families were permitted to live in the town. A synagogue was built on the Jewish Street, which was located near the cemetery. The community employed a cantor, who also served as a teacher. By 1670 there was a Talmud Torah, located in one of the Jewish houses. Later, when the noble families of Mansfeld and Lewinstein were in charge of the town, some of the laws that discriminated against the Jews were abolished; as a result, in 1779 there were 18 Jewish families living in Horazdovice. \n\nThe Thirty Years' War and its aftermath resulted in difficult economic times for the Jews of Horazdice. Heavy taxes were imposed on them, and there were economic restrictions preventing them from taking full advantage of local opportunities. Nonetheless, Jewish merchants were able to trade in grain, and from 1595 they also traded in cattle. Much later, after the emancipation of Austro-Hungarian Jews in 1848, the Jews of the region founded a distillery as well as factories for producing matches, paper, wool, and starch. In fact, the starch factory was so successful that it prompted potato farmers across Bohemia to form an agricultural cooperative, which bought the factory in 1912. The factory still exists, under the name Lyckeby Amylex. Herman Katz founded one of the largest and most successful grocery stores in southern Bohemia 1859; in 1907 his son, Otto, also founded a similarly successful grocery store. Another successful business was ironworks; Herman Katz's brother, Eduard, founded an ironworks shop, and Eduard Steiner also purchased a shop in 1907. In 1919 he purchased Vienna's Riesenrad Ferris wheel.  \n\nIn 1850 a Jewish school was opened, in which the language of instruction was German\u2014only one hour per day was devoted to studying the Czech language. In 1885, however, after an initiative led by the president of the community and owner of the Muenz Brothers distillery, Eduard Muenz, Czech was adopted as the language of instruction in the school, as well as the language of business for all of the community's institutions. The community also resolved that the rabbi's sermons would be delivered in Czech. Among the community's institutions at that time was a society for the promotion of the Czech language and culture. \n\nDuring the second half of the 19th century a new cemetery was consecrated and graves from the old cemetery were transferred to the new one. A chevra kaddisha also served the community. The synagogue also renovated in 1901, and electric lighting was installed. \n\nAmong the rabbis of the community were Rabbi B. Friedman, who was also an inventor who held various patents (including one about the automatic joining of railway trucks), and Rabbi Martin Friedman, who served from 1887 until 1931. \n\nIn 1848, Jews throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire were emancipated and the residence restrictions that they had been subject to were lifted. Jews began moving to larger towns and cities in search of greater economic and educational opportunities. This trend, coupled with the railroad that was built connecting Horazdovice to the railway system during this same period, resulted in a population decline as members of the Jewish community of Horazdovice began to move elsewhere. By 1893 Jews from 12 communities in nearby villages were absorbed into the shrinking community of Horazdovice (see below for information on two of these communities). \n\nAfter the establishment of the Republic of Czechoslovakia in 1918, and the recognition of Jews as a national minority, Zionism became popular in Horazdovice. In 1926 the Jews of Horazdovice purchased membership and voting rights before the elections to the 15th Zionist Congress.\n\nIn 1921 there were 187 Jews living in the community. By 1930 that number had dropped to 126. \n\nCOMMUNITIES AFFILIATED WITH HORAZDOVICE\n\nSlatina was the largest and most important community that was absorbed into Horazdovice. Jews most probably began living there at the end of the 16th century and at the beginning of the 17th century it became the central community for the Jews in the area. The Jewish Quarter consisted of approximately 10 houses and was located in the northern part of the village. A new synagogue built in 1850 replaced the former wooden synagogue; this new synagogue was renovated in 1893. A wing of the synagogue included a Talmud Torah, a kosher butcher, and a matzah factory. The rabbi lived in an apartment on the upper floor. This synagogue was in use until 1912; during World War I Jewish refugees from Poland were housed in the synagogue, and after 1919 the building was used to store grain. A cemetery was consecrated in 1723, though Jews had been buried at the site for years. The last burial took place in 1937. In 1724 there were 6 Jewish families (27 people) living n Slatina). Between 1858 and 1868 there were 33 families living in the village, and in 1913 only four Jewish families were living in the village. The last Jew living in Slatina was killed during World War I. \n\nRabi was another community in the area that was incorporated into Horazdice. The community included a school and a prayer house. The rabbi of the Prachen Region also lived in Rabi.  \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of September, 1938, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved. About half a year later, the Germans occupied the regions of Bohemia and Moravia, which became protectorates of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the areas' Jews. Beginning at the end of 1941 the Jews were concentrated in the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were deported to a series of concentration and death camps, where most were killed. Before their expulsion to Terezin, 286 documents and 130 ritual objects from the community of Horazdovice were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum of Prague. Of the nearly 100 Jews who were taken from Horazdovice, only 7 survived. None returned to the town after the war. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nThe synagogue building in Horazdovice was demolished in 1980, while that of Slatina was renovated in 1983. The section of Slatina's synagogue that once housed the Talmud Torah, kosher butcher, and matzah factory was converted into a private home as well as a memorial hall and exhibition about the history of the local Jews.  \n\n\n\n\n", "He": "\u05d4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d0\u05d6'\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05e6\u05d4 Horazdovice\r\n\r\n\u05d1\u05d2\u05e8\u05de\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea:

Bohemian Region, Czech Republic\n\nRudna is located 9 miles (15km) west of Prague. The town of Rudna was established in 1951 after the villages of Dusniky and Horalice merged. Until 1918 the region was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Between the two World Wars, and between the end of World War II and 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. \n\nThe Jewish community of Horelice was most probably established during the first half of the 16th century. It was one of the oldest Jewish communities in the region, and was made up of Jews from 18 villages in the area. The prayer house, which was burned down in 1842, was replaced by a synagogue. A Jewish school was opened in 1881.The community of Horelice did not have its own cemetery, and buried their dead in the cemeteries of Hostoun and Velka Morina. The community's institutions included a Bikkur Kholim Society for visiting the sick.\n\nAmong the community's rabbis were Rabbi Jacob Stutz, Rabbi Benjamin Neumann, Rabbi Julius Eisner, and Rabbi Moritz Steiner. \n\nIn 1898 there were 17 Jewish families living in Horelice. By 1918 there were 13 families living in the village. Shortly thereafter, in 1921, there were only 21 Jews living in Horelice. The synagogue was renovated in 1925, but the community ceased to function shortly thereafter, and many of the remaining Jews joined the community of Beroun. By 1930 there were only 6 Jewish families living in Horelice.\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nThe Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved following the Munich Agreement of September 1938. Six months later, Bohemia and Moravia became protectorates of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews living there.

Until 1918 the region was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Between the two World Wars, and between the end of World War II and 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia.\n\nOver 200 headstones have survived and remain standing in the Jewish cemetery, which can be accessed by visitors. \n\nHISTORY\n\nThere was a Jewish community in Horepnik by the first third of the 17th century and by 1723 Twenty-one Jewish families were recorded as living in the village. An established community was formed by 25 Jewish families during the middle of the 19th century. \n\nA Jewish Quarter, which held 20 homes, was located between the town square and the bridge over the River Trnavka. A cemetery was consecrated at the beginning of the 17th century; the oldest tombstones date to 1649, but there were probably older graves. The synagogue was built in 1800, and the community also had a Jewish school. \n\nAfter the emancipation of Jews throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1848, and the subsequent removal of economic and residence restrictions, Jews began moving to larger towns and cities in search of new economic and educational opportunities. Jewish populations in communities such as Horepnik declined.

Until 1918 the region was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Between the two World Wars, and from the end of World War II until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe Jewish cemetery has about 130 tombstones, dating from the 18th to the 20th century and includes a mortuary. \n\nHISTORY \n\nIt is unclear when, exactly, Jews first began to settle in Horni Cerekev, but a Jewish cemetery was established by the 18th century. A synagogue was built later, in 1867. Following the emancipation of Jews throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the subsequent lifting of economic and residence restrictions, many Jews began moving to larger towns and cities, in search of greater educational and economic opportunities. As a result, communities such as Horni Cerekev saw their populations decline. By 1922 only 40 Jews remained in the town. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nThe Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved following the Munich Agreement of September 1938. A few months later, in March 1939, the region of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of violence and discrimination against the region's Jews.

Between the two World Wars, and between the end of World War II and 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. From 1938 until 1945 Horsovsky Tyn was part of Sudetenland. \n\nAccording to an oral tradition, there were Jews living in Horsovsky Tyn by the first half of the 16th century. This is evidenced by the fact that during the second half of the 19th century ruins of a synagogue and mikvah were visible. Additionally, a field outside of the town, was referred to by the locals as \"the field near the Jewish cemetery,\" in spite of the fact that no tombstones have been found there, indicating that there had been a Jewish community in Horsovsky Tyn. According to one story, the town's Jews were all killed in a pogrom during the 16th century. Another account claims that the Jews of Horsovsky Tyn were killed by the owner of the estate, who fell in love with the rabbi's daughter but was rebuffed. \n\nRegardless of when Jews originally settled in the town and their reasons for leaving (voluntarily or otherwise), it is clear that after the emancipation of Jews throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1848, and the subsequent repeal of residence restrictions, Jews began to (re)settle in Horsovsky Tyn. The first Jewish funeral was recorded in 1858 and in 1875 there were 12 Jewish families living in the town. These families bought a house and turned it into a place for prayer. They also hired a teacher, and in 1883 they opened a Jewish school in which the language of instruction was German. The community regulations were officially authorized in 1896. Jews from small neighboring villages were affiliated with the community of Horsovsky Tyn, but since Horsovsky Tyn did not have its own cemetery, the dead were buried in the cemetery of the larger Jewish community of Puclice, approximately 4 miles (6km) to the northeast. \n\nIn 1921 there were 99 Jews living at Horsovsky Tyn. The community was led by Dr. J. Kahler and contained a prayer house, a cemetery, and a chevra kaddisha. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of September 1938 the Sudeten Region, which included Horsovsky Tyn, was annexed to Nazi Germany. Evidence points to the fact that at that point all of the Jews of Horsovsky Tyn left, and many moved to Bohemia and Moravia. Six months later, however, the region of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germay, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews living there. Beginning in 1941, the Jews were concentrated in the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were deported to concentration and death camps, where most were killed. \n\nSixteen Jews who died during a death March in April 1945 are buried at Horsovsky Tyn.\n\nPOSTWAR\n\nJews did not return to Horsovsky Tyn after the war. The prayer house was eventually turned into a club.

Part of the Sudeten Region from 1938 until 1945. Hostinne is located 64 miles (103km) from Prague and approximately 11 miles (18km) from the city of Trutnov. \n\nIt is not clear when Jews first came to settle in Hostinne, but the first records of them living there date to the 1780s. \n\nIn 1830 there is one Jew listed as living in Hostinne; in 1840 another Jewish person is listed as having leased the local distillery. During the 1840s six Jews lived in Hostinne and were affiliated with the community of Horitz. Later, local Jews were affiliated with the community of Trutnov (German: Trautenau); there was no organized community at Hostinne. \n\nA cemetery was consecrated at Hostinne in 1884; previously, the dead had been buried in the Jewish cemetery at Antoniusberg. There was no synagogue at Hostinne, though it is likely that there was a prayer house. Services were mostly held in Trutnov. \n\nJews originally worked in the production and marketing of a flax processing factory that was founded in Hostinne in 1767. Later, Jewish residents of the town opened a factory for wool processing. During the second half of the 19th century, Jews established a spinning mill at Hostinne for linen and jute yarns, as well as silk factories and weaving mills for cloth handkerchiefs, napkins, and towels. Jews also engaged in the production of cardboard, paper, and spirits. Other Jews in Hostinne worked as merchants, one owned a shoe shop, one was a physician, and one was a high school teacher. \n\nIn 1880 there were 62 Jews living in Hostine; the total number of Jews living in the town and the neighboring villages was 76. In 1900 there were 92 Jews living in Hostinne and in 1910 the Jewish population was 106. The census of 1921 indicates that there were 95 Jews living in Hostinne and the surrounding neighborhood (5% of the total population), 14 of whom declared their nationality as Jewish. In 1930 there were 71 Jews found to be living in Hostinne and the surrounding neighborhoods, 13 of whom declared their nationality as Jewish. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nAfter the Munich Agreement of September 1938, the Sudeten Region was annexed to Nazi Germany and the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved. The small number of Jews living in Hostinne managed to escape to Bohemia and Moravia, which were then still part of Czech territory. However, in March 1939 the region of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the area's Jews. Beginning in 1941 the Jews began to be concentrated in the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto, and from there they were deported to concentration and death camps, where most were killed. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nJews did not return to Hostinne after the war. The Jewish cemetery was damaged by the Nazis during the war and completely destroyed by Czech authorities during the 1950s and '60s. There are remnants  of 11 tombstones, as well as the tombstone of Henriette Muller, which dates to 1902.

miles (7km) southeast of the district town of Kladno. Until 1918 the region was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Between the two World Wars, and between the end of World War II and 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. \n\nThe Prague Jewish community owns the cemetery in Hostoun and funds its maintenance. A number of tombstones are still standing, and are written in Hebrew, Czech, and German. \n\nHISTORY\n\nThe Jewish community of Hostoun, which was most probably established during the first half of the 16th century, also incorporated Jews from 21 small villages in the area. The first official record of a Jewish presence in the village dates to 1792. \n\nAmong the rabbis of the community were Rabbi Nathaniel of Hostoun, who served at the end of the 18th century, Rabbi Yehezkel Landau, Rabbi Elazar Flekles, and Rabbi Joseph (who served around 1817). A synagogue was built in Hostoun during the first half of the 19th century. The community also included a community house, a school in which the language of instruction was German, and a cemetery. A new cemetery was consecrated in 1856. The community was also served by a chevra kaddisha. \n\nIn 1852 there were 64 Jewish families living in the village, and Rabbi Dr. M. Asher served the community. In 1921 there were 21 Jews living in Hostoun. At that point, the Jews of Hostoun primarily spoke Czech. The community's leader was Joseph Kohn, and the rabbi was Max Schwartz. \n\nIn 1930 there were only 35 Jews remaining in Hostoun, 5 of whom declared their nationality as Jewish. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nThe Munich Agreement of September 1938 resulted in the dissolution of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. On March 15, 1939, the region of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the region's Jews. \n\nBeginning in 1941 the Germans began to concentrate the Jews of the protectorate in the Terezin (Teresienstadt) Ghetto.

It became a crossroads for the trade routes between Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia to the capital in Prague. Until 1918 the region was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Between the two World Wars, and between the end of World War II and 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe Jewish cemetery, which includes a pre-burial house, is owned by the Jewish community of Prague. Most of the tombstones have been damaged, and some have been moved from the cemetery to a museum. The cemetery has also been vandalized a number of times throughout the years. \n\nHISTORY\n\nThere are records of Jews living in the region from 1052; Jews lived in Hradec Kralove itself from the city's founding. There was a Jewish Quarter in the city that local residents called \"Platea Judeorum,\" \"The Jewish Hill,\" which was separated from the central square of the town by an iron gate that was locked every evening. \n\nAt the beginning of the 15th century there were never more than 10 Jewish families living in the city and they were expelled several times between the years 1454 and 1521. Beginning in 1551 they were compelled to wear special clothes that would identify them as Jews. In 1628 the king allowed only a small number of privileged families, including that of David Tachovsky and the rabbi appointed by the authorities, the right to live in Hradec Kralove. These families were subsequently expelled in 1652. \n\nA deist sect that refused to classify themselves as Jews or Christians, and instead referred to themselves as Abrahamites, became active in the area in 1742. They were led by a man named Mendel from the community of Novy Bydzov. This sect was persecuted (they would eventually be excluded from Emperor Joseph II's edict of toleration in 1781) and in 1750 many of them, including Mendel, were tortured and executed at Hradec Kralove.\n\nIn 1742 one Jewish person was given permission to trade in the annual fair, while another worked as a distiller. Several more Jewish merchants were given permission to trade in the city in 1774. In 1808 Joseph Winternitz founded a distillery in Hradec Kralove to produce alcoholic liquors. He was well known, both among Jews and non-Jews, as a generous philanthropist. Philip Levy was a tobacco dealer in the area during the same period. \n\nMany Jewish merchants arrived at Hradec Kralove at the beginning of the 19th century and a community was organized in 1860; a community register started to be kept in 1864. At that time most Jews lived in the area around the city; even by 1873 only 8 Jews lived in Hradec Kralove itself. In 1877 the community bought land for a cemetery. In 1890 the officers of the community were elected, and shortly thereafter, in 1896, the community's regulations were approved by the authorities. The community's institutions included a chevra kaddisha, a women's organization, and a society that assisted both Jewish students and the poor. A large synagogue was built in 1905. \n\nIn 1921 there were 314 Jews living in Hradec Kralove. The president of the community at that time was Dr. Joseph Taussik, and the secretary was Oscar Eisner. \n\nDuring the interwar period Jews were recognized as a national minority, and a significant number of Jews in Hradec Kralove became involved with Jewish nationalism. In 1926 the Jews of Hradec Kralove purchased membership and voting rights to the Zionist conference, and a number voted in the 1937 elections to the 20th Zionist Congress.  A branch of the Maccabi youth movement was active in the city. By 1930 about 10% of the Jews of Hradec Kralove and the surrounding area declared their nationality as Jewish. In 1931 when the Jewish Party of Czechoslovakia was founded, Dr. Milan Kolman from Hradec Kralove was elected to the party's central committee; Dr. Kolman, along with Hermann Stapler, was a delegate to the last regional conference of the Zionist Federation. \n\nIn 1930 there were 425 Jews living in Hradec Kralove (2.39% of the total population).\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nAfter the Munich Agreement of September 1938 the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved. The Sudeten Region was annexed to Nazi Germany, and many Jews who escaped from Sudetenland found refuge in Hradec Kralove. This was during a period of rising anti-Semitism; attempts by refugees to open shops in the town led to anti-Jewish responses. Anti-Semitic graffiti was left on the walls of the synagogue and anti-Semitic leaflets were circulated throughout the city. In March 1939 the Germans entered the region of Bohemia and Moravia, which became protectorates of Nazi Germany. This ushered in a period of official discrimination and violence against the area's Jews; Jews were harassed by Czech anti-Semites, particularly the youth. By 1941 approximately 80 members of the community, of the 1,554 Jews living in the city, converted to Christianity, in an attempt to save themselves. \n\nBetween May 28 and June 2, 1942, the Jews of Hradec Kralove were ordered to register for transfer. On December 17 and December 21, 1942, 1,198 Jews from the city were sent to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto; the first of these transports also included Jews from smaller communities in the area, including Dvur Kralove, Zamberg, Horice, Nachod, Jaromer, and Josefov. From Terezin they were transferred to concentration and death camps, where most were killed. The only Jews remaining in Hradec Kralove were those who were either married to Christians, or who were half-Jewish. Before the Jews of Hradec Kralove were sent to Terezin, 1,265 documents, 20 books, and 125 ritual objects from the community were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague.\n\nPOSTWAR \n\nOnly 106 Jews from  the region survived the war, 16 of whom were from Hradec Kralove. Some Jews came to Hradec Kralove after the war; on April 30, 1945 there were 190 Jews recorded as living in the city. A monument in memory of the victims of the Holocaust was erected, inscribed with the names of 1,376 of the city's dead. \n\nBy the 1950s most Jews had left Hradec Kralove. The synagogue building was converted into a municipal library. \n\nDuring Israel's War of Independence in 1948 the first aircraft used by the Israeli Air Force were flown from the airfield near Hradec Kralove.

Republic\n\nHranice is sometimes informally referred to as \"Hranice na Morave,\" in order to distinguish it from other places with the same name. Until 1918 Hranice and the region were part of the Austrian monarchy. Between the two World Wars, and during the postwar communist era, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. \n\nThe Jewish cemetery is still standing, though not all of the gravestones have remained in their original locations; the cemetery has been vandalized in the past, and some tombstones were removed and sent to a museum. \n\nHISTORY\n\nThe first Jews at Hranice were those who arrived for market days and subsequently decided to settle under the protection of the nobles of the House of Pernstein (1475-1553). They were followed by Jewish cattle merchants from Romania and Poland. The town's records first mention Jews in 1644. During the middle of the 17th century, following the Chmielnicki Pogroms, many Jewish refugees arrived at Hranice from Poland. \n\nIn 1753 there were 115 Jewish families living in the town. The population rose and by 1788 there were 120 Jewish families in Hranice. In addition to families, there were also a number of single Jews living in Hranice who could not legally marry because of the Families Law, which permitted only the firstborn sons in Jewish families to marry. \n\nThe Jewish community functioned independently from the rest of the town. There was a Jewish street, consisting of a row of houses along the wall on the west side of the town, a few houses on Teplice Street, as well as houses on one other street. The old synagogue stood at the corner of the Jewish Street, opposite the town square.  In 1864 the old synagogue was demolished and replaced by a new synagogue. The cemetery was consecrated following the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) and also served the neighboring communities, particularly that of Neu Titschein (Slovak: Novy Jicin); Julius Freud, the brother of Sigmund Freud, would later be buried in the cemetery. A chevra kaddisha would be formed much later, in 1875, and a women's society was established in 1896. \n\nA Jewish school was opened around 1770. It was managed alternately by Jewish and non-Jewish teachers, and the language of instruction was German. In 1865, by which time the school was an elementary Hebrew-German school, two classes were added. In 1876 a crafts class was added for girls, and beginning in 1888 they were taught Czech twice a week. The school closed in 1919, at which point the Jewish students attended the regular schools in the town. \n\nBeginning around 1770, Hranice had its own rabbis serving the community. The community's first rabbi was Menachem Mendel of Leipnik. Rabbi Dr. Jacob Rabinowitz, a professor of Oriental studies, philosophy, and history, was appointed in 1894 and served well into the 1930s. He published articles, novels, and plays that were printed in the German and Austrian press. \n\nUntil the emancipation of Jews throughout the Austrian Empire in 1848, the community was led by what was known as \"judges\" and \"jurors.\" Only one, Ezechias Kafka, who led the community at the beginning of the 19th century, is known by name. After 1848 the Jewish Quarter was administered by Jewish mayors, who were also the leaders of the communities. These Jewish mayors included Sigmund Wolf, Abraham Wolf, Dr. Wilhelm Wolf, Noe Stross, Shimon Stross, Salomon Schlesinger, Adolf B. Adler, and Adolf Schlesinger. \n\nThe community reached its population peak in 1857, when it had 802 members. During the second half of the 19th century, however, after the emancipation and the subsequent lifting of residence restrictions, Jews throughout the region began moving to larger towns and cities seeking newer and more varied educational and economic opportunities. The community of Hranice, like others in the region, began to decline in numbers. \n\nIn 1885 the Jewish political organization was separated from the religious community. In 1919 the political community was abolished, and the Jewish town was integrated into the Christian town. Karl Baron and Sigmund Polack were the Jewish community's representatives to the town's council. \n\nAmong the notable figures born in Hranice are the journalist, poet, and playwright Jacob Julius David (1859-1906), the composer Max Wolf, Dr. Isidor Winger, who published the Jewish Encyclopedia in New York, and Aaron Chorin, the major advocate of Reform Judaism in Hungary. \n\nFollowing the emancipation, the Jews became more integrated economically, professionally, and socially. Rather than working strictly as merchants and craftsmen, Jews were also becoming professionals such as physicians and academics. Jews also began to be involved in Zionism, particularly after being recognized as a national minority in 1918 and being granted cultural and national autonomy. The Zionist organization Emunah established a branch at Hranice in 1819. There were also a number of Zionist youth organizations that were active. Before the 15th Zionist Congress in 1927, members of the community purchased membership and voting rights; 43 Jews from Hranice subsequently took part in the elections to the 20th Zionist Congress in 1937. \n\nIn 1930, there were 192 Jews living in Hranice.\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of September 1938, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved. On March 15, 1939 German forces entered the regions of Bohemia and Moravia, which subsequently became protectorates of Nazi Germany. This ushered in a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews of the region. Beginning in 1941, the Jews were deported to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto, after which they were sent to concentration and death camps, where most were killed. Before their deportation to Terezin, 85 documents and books, and 125 ritual objects were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nFourteen Jews returned to Hranice after the war. Though a community was revived, it did not remain active. A prayer house functioned until 1969. In 1996 the synagogue was reconstructed and converted into a museum and art gallery. \n\n", "He": "\u05d4\u05e8\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9\u05e6\u05d4

Nachod District, Czech Republic. Hronov is located near the Polish border.\n\nHronov was granted the status of a small town in 1870. Until 1918 Hronov and the region were part of the Austrian monarchy. Between the two World Wars, and during the postwar communist era, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. \n\nThe first Jews settled in Hronov during the 18th century. However, the population never grew significantly, and by the second half of the 19th century only a few Jewish families were living in Hronov. Following the emancipation of Jews throughout the Austrian Empire in 1848, the Jews of Hronov established textile factories in the area and were able to trade without restrictions. \n\nThe Republic of Czechoslovakia, which was established in 1918 after the end of World War I, granted its Jews cultural and national autonomy. This led to both an increase in the number of Jews becoming fully integrated into public and cultural life, as well as those who became interested in Zionism and Jewish nationalism. The Jews of Hronov purchased membership and voting rights before the 15th Zionist Congress in 1926; in 1937 fifteen Jews from Hronov participated in the elections to the 20th Zionist Congress. \n\nAmong the notable figures from Hronov is the Czech writer Egon Hostovsky; in 1990 a memorial plaque was affixed to the house where he was born. \n\nThe census of 1921 found 70 Jews living in Hronov, out of a total population of 3,798. Twelve of those Jews declared their nationality as Jewish, while the others declared themselves as Czech.  In 1930 there were 65 Jews living in Hronov (out of a total population of 4,180), of whom 11 declared their nationality as Jewish. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of September 1938, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved. On March 15, 1939 German forces entered the regions of Bohemia and Moravia, which subsequently became protectorates of Nazi Germany. This ushered in a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews of the region. Beginning in 1941, the Jews were deported to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto, after which they were sent to concentration and death camps, where most were killed. The artist Friedl Dicker-Brandeis, who was born in Vienna and escaped to Hronov in 1938, was among those deported to Terezin and then Auschwitz, where she was killed. \n", "He":

Republic\n\nHroubovice is located 10 miles (16km) from the district town of Chrudim and 71 miles (115km) from Prague. Until 1918 Hroubovice and the region were part of the Austrian monarchy. Between the two World Wars, and during the postwar communist era, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe Jewish cemetery is owned by the Jewish community of Prague, which funds its maintenance. The cemetery is accessible and contains tombstones dating from the 18th through the 20th centuries, as well as a pre-burial house. \n\nThe Jewish cemetery of Prestavlky is also accessible and includes approximately 70 tombstones. \n\nHISTORY\n\nJews began to settle in Hroubovice at the beginning of the 18th century; towards the end of the century the community was officially organized. A Baroque-style synagogue was built, as was a school and a number of Jewish houses, which stood in the center of the village along a stream. A cemetery was consecrated north of the village. \n\nDuring the middle of the 19th century there were 50 Jewish families living in Hroubovice, making up nearly half of the village's population. They owned a total of 30 houses. However, towards the end of the 19th century, after the emancipation of Jews throughout the Austrian Empire in 1848 and the subsequent lifting of residence restrictions, Jews began to move to larger towns and cities, in search of new economic and educational opportunities. As a result, the Jewish community of Hroubovice, like those of other communities in the region, became significantly smaller and in 1894 the independent congregation was dissolved. \n\nDuring the interwar period Zionism became popular in the area. Jews from Hroubovice purchased membership and a voting right before the 15th Zionist Congress in 1927. \n\nA number of Jews lived in villages around Hroubovice. One of these villages was Zajesdec, which was located 4 miles (7km) northwest of Hroubovice. By the 18th century there was already a Jewish community in Zajesdec, and the Jews made up about one-third of Zajesdec's population. A Jewish cemetery was consecrated at the end of the 18th century. An Empire-style synagogue was also built, and was later demolished in 1925. \n\nAnother village affiliated with Hroubovice was Prestavkly, which was located 5 miles (8km) northwest of Hroubovice. A synagogue was built in Prestabkly during the first half of the 19th century and a cemetery was consecrated in 1844. Jews formed approximately one-third of the village's inhabitants. The Czech Jewish journalist Victor Vohryzek was born in Prestavkly in 1864 and died in 1918 in Pardubice. \n\nIn 1930 only 30 Jews were living in Hroubovice. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of September 1938, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved. On March 15, 1939 German forces entered the regions of Bohemia and Moravia, which subsequently became protectorates of Nazi Germany. This ushered in a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews of the region. Beginning in 1941, the Jews were deported to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto, after which they were sent to concentration and death camps, where most were killed.\n\nPOSTWAR\n\nAfter the war only two survivors from Hroubovice returned to the village. Jewish life was not revived. Most of the Jewish homes in the former Jewish Quarter were refurbished or rebuilt, though burials continued to take place in the cemetery. The synagogue building was demolished by Czech authorities in 1979. \n\nThe synagogue of Prestavkly was sold and turned into a private home.

miles (4km) north of Karlovy Vary (German: Karlsbad). Until 1918 Hroznetin and the region were part of the Austrian Empire. Between the two World Wars, and during the postwar communist era, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. From 1938 until 1945 it was part of the Sudeten Region. \n\nThe Jewish cemetery in Hroznetin was originally established at the end of the 15th century, making it one of the oldest in Bohemia. Nearly 300 tombstones remain, the oldest of which dates to the late 17th century. The cemetery has been vandalized, most recently in 2006 when vandals destroyed several tombstones. \n\nHISTORY\n\nJews who had been forbidden from settling in Karlovy Vary (German: Karlsbad) settled in the villages and estates in the surrounding area, and the first documentation of Jews at Hroznetin dates to 1503. In 1570 there were 16 Jewish taxpayers recorded living in Hroznetin (which at that point was called Lichtenstadt). They lived in a special quarter that would later include the synagogue that was built during the 18th century. The cemetery was consecrated at the end of the 15th century. Beginning in 1782 the community began to keep its own register; previously, births and deaths within the local Jewish community were recorded by Catholic priests. During the 17th century the Jews of Hroznetin worked as traders and peddlers. Between 1675 and 1699 a number of Jews from Lichtenstadt are recorded as participating in the fairs of Leipzig. \n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries Hroznetin became one of the most important Jewish communities in Bohemia. The court Jew and leader of Bohemian Jewry, Abraham Aaron Lichtenstadt, was based in Hroznetin. It was also frequently mentioned in halakhic response from the time. \n\nAmong the rabbis who served the community were Rabbi Joseph Lasch Lerner, Rabbi Israel, Rabbi Yekhezkel Nussbaum (1899-1902), and Rabbi Herman Spielman (1902-1905). In 1921 Rabbi Samuel Springer served as rabbi, and Dr. Samuel Max was the president of the community. \n\nIn 1570 there were 16 Jewish families living in Hroznetin; by 1708 there were 298 Jews living in the town. Records from 1724 indicate that there were 47 Jewish families living in Hroznetin that year. 457 Jews lived in Hroznetin in 1857 (29% of the total population).  \n\nIn 1848 the Jews of the Austrian Empire were emancipated, and residence restrictions were lifted. This prompted Jews to move to larger towns and cities in pursuit of further educational and economic opportunities. Though the population of Hroznetin had increased in the period just after the emancipation, the community began to decline soon after. Towards the end of the 19th century most of the Jews of Hroznetin moved to Neidek (German: Neudek), Karlovy Vary, as well as to a number of other towns and cities. In 1869 there were only 77 Jews living in Hroznetin. By 1921 the Jewish population had further dropped to 44. There were only 7 Jews living in Hroznetin in 1932. \n\nDuring World War I, fourteen members of the Jewish community of Hroznetin were killed in action. By World War II the community had ceased to exist.  \n\n\n", "He": "\u05d4\u05e8\u05d5\u05d6\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05d8\u05d9\u05df HROZNETIN\r\n\r\n(\u05d1\u05de\u05e7\u05d5\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea

Pardubice Region, Chrudim District, Czech Republic\n\nBoth the synagogue and Jewish cemetery of Hermanuv Mestec have been declared national cultural monuments. \n\nThe synagogue building was restored in 2001, and is part of a cultural center; the Jewish school was also reconstructed as part of the restoration and houses the Cyrany Gallery. The synagogue's stained glass windows, as well as an Ark crowned by the Ten Commandments, can be viewed. In 2008, the restored synagogue hosted a Simchat Torah celebration. \n\nThe Jewish cemetery contains over 1,000 tombstones. It is owned by the Jewish community of Prague, and maintained by a local caretaker. \n\nA Torah scroll sent from Hermanuv Mestec to the Jewish Museum in Prague during World War II was later sent to Temple Sinai in Wellington, New Zealand.    \n\nHISTORY\n\nJews began settling in Hermanuv Mestec towards the end of the 15th century; ten Jewish families are mentioned in a document dating from 1570. Existing acts and rulings of the community's chevra kaddisha date from 1643, and the first cemetery expansion is recorded in 1667. In 1686 a local nobleman invited Jews to settle in houses that formerly belonged to Christians who had died of the plague. \n\nBy the end of the 19th century the town became a center for manufacturing shoes, thanks to the presence of several successful Jewish businesses. \n\nNoteworthy community rabbis include Moses Simchah Bumsla, and Moses Bloch. \n\nIn 1724 there were 63 Jewish families living in Hermanuv Mestec; by 1826 there were 496 Jews living in the town. The population grew to 721 Jews in 1859, and 434 (9.3% of the total population) in 1880. In 1893 there were 300 Jews living in Hermanuv Mestec itself and a total of 1,085 in the town and the surrounding villages. \n\nBy 1921 the Jewish population of Hermanuv Mestec had declined to 87, largely as a result of emigration. \n\nIn 1942 the remaining Jews of Hermanuv Mestec were deported to Auschwitz via Terezin (Theresienstadt). Before the deportation, a number of ritual objects from the community were sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. \n\nAfter World War II the synagogue was used as a church, and then as a warehouse. \n\n", "He": "\u05d4\u05d6'\u05de\u05d0\u05e0\u05d5\u05d1 \u05de\u05d9\u05d9\u05e1\u05d8\u05e5 HERMANUV MESTEC\r\n\r\n\u05d1\u05d2\u05e8\u05de\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea:

Until 1918 Humpolec and the region were part of the Austrian monarchy. Between the two World Wars, and during the postwar communist era, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia.\n\nA Torah scroll from Humpolec that was sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague during World War II has been on permanent loan to the synagogue Am Yisrael of the North Shore in Glencoe, Illinois since 1970. \n\nThe Jewish cemetery was badly damaged by the Nazis during World War II. Nonetheless, many of the tombstones are still standing. During the 1990s the cemetery and ceremonial hall were restored, and a memorial plaque was erected in honor of the victims of the Holocaust. Among those buried in the cemetery are Simon and Mary Mahler, the grandparents of composer Gustav Mahler (Mahler himself was born in the neighboring village of Kaliste). \n\nHISTORY\n\nRuins of a 13th-century synagogue have been found in Humpolec, though it is unclear precisely when Jews first began arriving in the town. A few Jewish families were recorded as living in Humpolec in 1385 but there is no mention of Jews in the following centuries and the 1618 census does not list any Jews as living in the town. In 1719, however, 10 Jewish families (49 people) were living in Humpolec under the protection of the noble family Heralec. At this point the community began to organize: it purchased land for a cemetery, and religious services were held in private homes. A synagogue was built in 1762. By 1787 there were 24 Jewish families living in Humpolec. \n\nLevy Bauer was elected president of the community in 1801. At that point the community began establishing a number of organizations, including a fund to provide dowries for poor prides, a fund to help the town's poor, a hospital, and public baths. A Bikkur Holim Society was established during the 1850s, in addition to a charity fund and a fund for assisting poor students. The community's president at the time, Ignatz Hellman, also founded a synagogue choir.\n\nFollowing the emancipation of Jews throughout the Austrian Empire in 1848, the Jews of Humpolec began pursuing academic careers, whereas previously most had worked as merchants and traders. These newly-minted academics joined the Union of Jewish Academics of Bohemia in Prague. They also began to more fully integrate into the town's political life. By 1861 three members of the community had been elected to the town's council. \n\nA Jewish school was established in 1861 in which the language of instruction was Hebrew and German. A special fund, Ner Tamid, was established in order to support the school, though the school was ultimately closed in 1902. By that point, at the turn of the 20th century, the community had a number of other social institutions, including a Talmud Torah, a chevra kaddisha, societies to support women in need, and a singing group called Shirat Zion. \n\nA fire in 1825 destroyed 10 Jewish homes. In 1886 another fire broke out in the Jewish Quarter and destroyed the school and 9 homes, and damaged the synagogue. With the help of donations a new school building was built. The synagogue was also renovated, and an organ was installed as part of the renovation. In 1905 the community purchased a building that included an apartment for the cantor. \n\nRabbi Dr. Moritz Wohl was appointed as the community's first rabbi in 1894 and served until 1898. He was followed by Rabbi Marek Tedlinsky, who served until 1942 when the community was destroyed and Rabbi Tedlinsky perished along with his congregants. Between 1719 and 1902 the community had 17 presidents, many of whom were from the same families, including the Bauer, Levy, Bondi, and Hellman families. A jurist whose last name was Lederer was appointed as president of the community in 1902. He reorganized the community's institutions, and among his activities he began offering private Hebrew lessons for members of the community and the surrounding areas, and established organized help for needy Jewish travelers. \n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century the Jewish community of Humpolec, as well as the surrounding areas (Veri, Heralci, Vojslavice, Cejove) consisted of 63 families (320 people). In 1922 there were 270 Jews registered as living in Humpolec. That year, Dr. Otto Posamentir was elected as the community's president. He served until 1926.  \n\nA blood libel was levied against the Jews in 1903, leading to outbreaks of anti-Semitism. Ultimately, however, the Christian woman who was responsible for spreading the blood libel was charged and imprisoned. \n\nDuring World War I Jews of Humpolec enlisted in the Austro-Hungarian army. Throughout the war Jewish refugees from Poland and Bukovina arrived in the town, which proved challenging for the community who struggled to absorb them. In addition, the influx of refugees led to a rise in anti-Semitism among the Christian citizens of the town. When the war ended in 1918, a festive public prayer was held at the synagogue in honor of the newly established Republic of Czechoslovakia. This new republic recognized the Jews as a national minority, and granted them cultural-national autonomy.\n\nIn 1930 there were 89 Jews living in Humpolec. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nThe Munich Agreement of September 1938 led to the dissolution of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, and annexed the Sudeten Region to Nazi Germany. As a result, most of the Jews of the region moved to Bohemia and Moravia. In March 1939 the region of Bohemia and Moravia were annexed to Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews of the region. That year, one Jewish woman from Humpolec emigrated to Mandate Palestine.\n\nBeginning in 1941 the Germans began deporting Czech Jews to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps, where most were killed. Before their deportation to Terezin, 32 documents and 142 ritual objects from the community were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nSome of the Jews from Humpolec survived the war, but none returned to the town. \n\n\n\n", "He": "\u05d4\u05d5\u05de\u05e4\u05d5\u05dc\u05e5 Humpolec\r\n\r\n\u05d1\u05d2\u05e8\u05de\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea: Gumpolds \u05d0\u05d5

Between the two World Wars, and during the postwar communist era, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Hustopece was also part of the Sudeten Region.\n\nJews probably settled in Hustopece during the late 14th century, and had formed a community by 1580. However, they were later expelled, after which no Jews lived in the town until 1848 when the Jews of the empire were emancipated and residence restrictions were lifted. A synagogue was built in 1880, and a cemetery was consecrated in 1886. \n\nIn 1922 there were 165 Jews in the community. The president of the community was J. Berisch, and the rabbi was Dr. Isaac Boeck. The community's institutions included a chevra kaddisha and a singing society. \n\nThe Republic of Czechoslovakia, which was formed after World War I, recognized the Jews as a national minority. As a result, during the interwar period, Jewish communities throughout the country became politically engaged, and often became active in Zionist movements. Before the 15th Zionist Congress, community members of Hustopece purchased membership and voting rights. \n\nDuring the census of 1930, there were 286 Jews living in Hustopece and the surrounding villages. Of these, 118 declared their nationality as Jewish. In Hustopece itself there were 149 Jews, 75 of whom declared their nationality as Jewish. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nThe Munich Agreement of September 1938 led to the dissolution of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, and annexed the Sudeten Region to Nazi Germany. As a result, most of the Jews of the region moved to Bohemia and Moravia. In March 1939 the region of Bohemia and Moravia were annexed to Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews of the region. \n\nBeginning in 1941 the Germans began deporting Czech Jews to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps, where most were killed. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nJewish life was not renewed at Hustopece after the war.

Until 1918 Ivancice was part of the Austrian Empire. Between the two World Wars, and during the postwar communist era, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. \n\nThe new synagogue, which was built in 1853 to replace the town's first synagogue, was used as a storage space for 50 years. Since 2008 it has undergone a reconstruction process in order to restore it for the town's cultural needs. \n\nThe Jewish cemetery has nearly 1,800 tombstones, the oldest of which dates to 1580. It also includes a ceremonial hall, which was built in 1902. The cemetery can be visited after making an appointment. \n\nOf the 73 homes that once stood in the Jewish Quarter, 52 remain. A wall-mounted plaque on 1 Krumlovska Street memorializes where the transit and internment camp for Jews was located between 1938 and 1942.  \n\nHISTORY\n\nThe Jewish community of Ivancice is one of the oldest in Moravia. According to a local tradition, Jews arrived with Roman troops during the first century and were later expelled. By 956 there was already a synagogue in the town and the names of 157 Jews and 783 Christians appear in tax registers from the time.\n\nDuring the rule of the House of Premysl (895-1306) the Jews had equal rights when it came to taxes and owning property. They were also responsible for participating in building the town\u2019s walls and defending them, along with their Christian neighbors. They were not, however, permitted to carry arms and they did not work as officials for the local government. \n\n\nIn 1454 the community of Ivancice absorbed Jewish refugees from Austria and a number of royal towns of Moravia, thereby becoming among the largest and the most important of the Jewish communities in Moravia at that time. However, at the beginning of the 16th century, during the reign of Emperor Ferdinand of Hapsburg, the Jews became subjects to a number of economic restrictions and were also forced to wear a yellow badge that would identify them as Jewish. \n\nThe Jewish Ghetto of Ivancice was first established during the 14th century outside the town. It was subsequently moved inside the town walls to be administered as an autonomous municipal entity, with a Jewish mayor. The Jews of Ivancice and of a number of nearby settlements lived under the protection of the nobles of the House of Pernstein.\n\nDuring the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), following the persecution of the Christian reform sects by the Catholic Church, the number of Christians in Ivancice shrank. Simultaneously, the Jewish community began to grow, helped by the arrival of many refugees from Bohemia. This influx of Jewish refugees resulted in a 1650 edict forbidding any Jew to live in Moravia who arrived after 1618. \n\nThe community of Ivancice became officially organized around the 17th century. It had its own rabbi, dayanim (religious judges), a gabbai, and a chevra kaddisha. The Jewish cemetery, in which the oldest tombstone dated to 1552, was expanded during the 17th, and again in the 19th, century. \n\nIvancice's first recorded rabbi, Rabbi Abraham the son of Hirsch Foreis, served during the second half of the 17th century. He was succeeded by Rabbi David of Rakov, who in turn was succeeded by his son Rabbi Joseph Rakov. Rabbi Rakov was followed by Rabbi Elia ben Shmuel, Rabbi Nathan Zelig of Cracow, Rabbi Issachar ber Oppenheim (1829-1859), his son Rabbi Joachim Oppenheim, Rabbi Dr. Jacob Tauber, and Rabbi Dr. Hermann Handel (1881- 1925). Rabbi Handel was the community's last rabbi; afterwards, the community would refer to Rabbi Dr. Heinrich Flesch, the rabbi of Kanits. Ivancice also had a yeshiva that trained rabbis.\n\n\nThe town's original synagogue was built sometime during the 16th century; in 1853 a new synagogue was consecrated in its place. This new synagogue had a girls' choir that accompanied the cantor. While the Jewish community offered its children a Jewish education since the 16th century (there are records of a Jewish melamed, teacher of small children, dating to 1598), a Jewish school was opened 1823, in which the language of instruction was German. A new school was opened in 1833 and enrolled 121 pupils, some of whom were not Jewish. By 1856 this second school had 4 classes, however, in 1902 it was closed due to lack of enrollment and the building was used by the community to house the community\u2019s offices and the mikveh. A funeral house was built in the building's courtyard; the man in charge of Jewish burials served also as a policeman and jailer in the Jewish Quarter.\n\n\nIn 1752 the Jews of Ivancice lived in 67 houses. By 1791 the community had grown to 533 people (about 45% of the town's total population) living in 72 houses. In 1830 their number rose to 797, and in 1835 the Jewish population was 877. \n\nIn 1848 Jews throughout the Austrian Empire were emancipated, and residence restrictions were lifted. As a result, Jews throughout the region began moving to larger towns and cities in search of greater economic and educational opportunities. As a result, Jewish populations in places like Ivancice began to decline. By 1857 the population had dropped to 629 though twenty years later, in 1877, they still made up 25% of the total population. In 1900 the town's Jewish population was 564. During World War I the town's Jewish population saw an increase, a result of the many Jewish refugees arriving in Ivancice from Bukovina, but these refugees were asked to leave once the war was over.\n\nIn 1918 the heretofore autonomous Jewish town was united with the Christian town, after which the community's authority was restricted to religious and social welfare issues. In 1921 the president of the community was Alexander Stern. Among the community's institutions were a Bikkur Holim society, a women\u2019s society, and a charity organization.\n\nIt was only beginning in the second half of the 19th century, following the emancipation, that the Jews began to be able to take advantage of a wide range of economic opportunities. The first Jews in Ivancice made their living in crafts, trade and in leasing inns. Jews were not allowed to own real estate during the 17th century, limiting their economic activities, and during the 18th century Jewish merchants were allowed to conduct their business only in the town\u2019s market. After the emancipation, however, things changed. The Jews of Ivancice founded businesses and went into academic professions. The graduates of the German universities of Vienna, Prague, and Brno, who did not find suitable positions in their town left for other towns.\n\nThe Jews of Ivancice declared their nationality as German until the turn of the 20th century. At that point Ivancice became one of the centers of Czech nationalism, which led to tensions between the Christian residents of the town, who began identifying strongly as Czech, and their Jewish neighbors who were seen as other. The town's residents demonstrated in the Jewish Quarter, and withdrew their children from the Jewish school. Ultimately, once the Republic of Czechoslovakia was formed at the end of World War I, the new republic recognized the Jews as a national minority. Nonetheless, the nationalist friction between the Jews of Ivancice and the Czech townspeople continued until 1925.\n\nOnce Jews were recognized as a national minority within the Republic of Czechoslovakia, many became involved with Jewish nationalism and the Zionist movement. In 1921, 157 out of the 190 Jews of Ivancice declared their nationality as Jewish; the rest declared their nationality as Czech or German. During this period Zionism became popular; in 1926, members of the community purchased membership and voting rights prior to the 15th Zionist Congress, and continued to do so over the years. Jews were also active in the town's politics, and during the interwar period delegates from the Jewish community served on the town council. \n\nRelationships between the Jews and Czechs improved during the interwar period, so much so that Jewish assimilation rose and some younger members of the community married non-Jews.\n\nAmong the notable Jews from Ivancice are the actor, director, and playwright Leopold Adler, the musicologist Guido Adler, and the composer Hugo Weisgall. \n\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nThe Munich Agreement of September 1938 resulted in the dissolution of the Republic of Czechoslovakia and annexed the Sudeten Region to German. As a result, large numbers of Czech and Jewish refugees from the region came to nearby Ivancice, though many of them were expelled and forced to return to the annexed territory. Jews who refused to return were left stranded on the new border, without any shelter or protection. After the intervention of Jan Masaryk, the exiled president of Czechoslovakia who had fled to London, a transit camp was set up for the refugees at the leather factory of Moritz Goldmann, the president of the community of Ivancice. This transit camp functioned until 1942, and 801 refugees passed through it.\n\nIn March 1939 the Czech part of the republic (Bohemia and Moravia) became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews of the region. Under German rule, the community of Ivancice served as a regional community. The Jews were evicted from their houses and concentrated in the Jewish Quarter. Their property was nationalized, their rights were dispossessed, and they were sent to work in factories and in mines. \n\nBy November 1939 young Jewish men from the transit camp were deported to the concentration camp of Nisko in Poland. Some escaped and joined the Czech units that fought the Germans with the Soviet Red Army. Led by the Czech student Hynek Ruzicka, an anti-Nazi underground movement emerged at Ivancice which young Jews from the transit camp joined. In 1942 the Jews of Ivancice and the nearby transit camp were sent to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto in 4 transports, the first of which took place on March 11, 1942. Some of the deportees were sent to the concentration camp Maidanek, while others and others were sent to Auschwitz. The last Jews, those who were in mixed marriages, were deported in 1944.\n\nBefore the deportation, 517 documents and ritual objects from the Jewish community of Ivancice were sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nEighteen Jews from Ivancice survived the war. In May 1945, at the end of the war, the first of the community's survivors returned to Ivancice. They were mostly those from mixed marriages who were deported later, as well as the young men who had escaped from Nisko and fought in the Czech units. Most of them left Ivancice shortly thereafter, and only a few remained in the town. The synagogue building was demolished in 1950.", "He": "\u05d0\u05d9\u05d5\u05d5\u05d0\u05e0\u05e6'\u05d9\u05e6\u05d4 Ivancice\n\n(\u05d1\u05e4\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd

Republic\n\nIvanovice is located approximately 4 miles (7km) from the district town of Vyskov. Until 1918 Ivanovice and the region were part of the Austrian Empire. Between the two World Wars, and during the postwar communist era, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe Jewish cemetery is located behind a gas station and is in dire need of restoration. Hardly any tombstones remain upright, and many are broken. \n\nHISTORY\n\nIt is unclear precisely when Jews first settled in Ivanovice, however, tombstones dating from the 17th century indicate that by that point there were a significant number of Jews living there. By 1727 a synagogue had been built. There was also included community center. A chevra kaddisha was active. By the mid-20th century most of the Jews in the community spoke German. \n\nIn 1848 Jews throughout the Austrian Empire were emancipated, and received full civil rights. Residence restrictions were also removed, which led to a migration of Jews to larger towns and cities in search of greater economic and educational opportunities. This resulted in a population decline of the Jewish community of Ivanovice, among other, similar, Jewish communities in the region. In 1857 the Ivanovice Jewish community's population peaked at 483 (approximately 23% of the total population). By 1922, however, the Jewish community of Ivanovice had only 80 members. At that time the community was led by Hugo Hajek. By 1930 the Jewish population had dropped to 64. \n\nBetween the two World Wars, the Republic of Czechoslovakia officially recognized the Jews as a cultural and national minority, prompting many Jews to become involved with Jewish nationalism and Zionism. Several members of the Ivanovice community purchased membership and voting rights for the 15th Zionist Congress. \n\nAmong the notable people from Ivanovice was the scholar of Jewish literature, Gustav Karpeles, who was born in Ivanovice in 1848. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nThe Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved after the Munich Agreement of September 1938. In March 1939 the region of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews of the area. The Jews of Ivanovice were most likely deported to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto with the Jews of Brno around the end of 1941, and from there were sent to a number of concentration and death camps. Before they were sent to Terezin, 25 books and 78 ritual objects from the community of Ivanovice were sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nJewish life was not renewed in Ivanovice after the war. The synagogue building was converted into a Czechoslovak Hussite Church during the 1950s.  \n\n\n", "He": "\u05d0\u05d9\u05d5\u05d5\u05d0\u05e0\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05e6\u05d4 \u05e0\u05d0\u05d3

"Jablonec nad Nisou\n\nGerman: Gablonz an der Neisse\n\nTown in northern Bohemia, Czech Republic\n\nUntil 1918 Jablonec, along with the rest of the region, was part of the Austrian Empire. During the interwar period, and during the post-World War II communist era, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Between 1938 and 1945 it was one of the municipalities in the Sudeten Region.  \n\nIn 1990 a Holocaust memorial was built in the town. It includes a plaque that reads \"On this place there used to be a Jewish synagogue serving 300 Jewish families who helped with the development of Jablonec industry before World War II. On October 1938 Nazis occupied the town, desecrating and destroying the synagogue. Most of the Jewish residents were murdered in Nazi concentration camps. God bless them!\"\n\nHISTORY \n\nJews began to settle in Jablonec in 1847, drawn by the development of the glass jewelry industry. When the neighboring town of Smrzovka (German: Morchenstern), where most of the factories were located, made it difficult for the Jews to advance in the business, Jablonec became the industry's commercial center. \n\nA congregation (kultusverein) was founded in Jablonec in 1872 (the community would be legally established in 1893), a cemetery was consecrated in 1882, and a Moorish-style synagogue was dedicated in 1892. A substantial number of foreign citizens, who arrived at Jablonec as representatives of foreign firms, made up the congregation. The community also included a Women's Society.  \n\nDuring the period between the two World Wars the community statute of 1928 granted the Jewish community equal voting rights. During this period, in which Czech nationalism competed with German nationalism, and the Jews themselves were granted the status of a national minority, the majority of Jablonec's Jews supported German nationalism. At the same time, however, many also supported Zionism; chapters of Blau-Weiss and the Zionist Society Theodor Herzl were established in the town. It was also during the interwar period that the municipality prohibited shechitah (kosher slaughtering) in the slaughterhouse. \n\nThe Jewish population in Jablonec was 214 in 1869. By 1880 the Jewish population had risen to 430. In 1895 there were 517 Jews in the town, and 799 in 1930 (2% of the total population).\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nAfter the Sudeten Crisis and the subsequent Munich Agreement of September 1938, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved, and the Sudeten Region was annexed to Nazi Germany. Most of the Jews left Jablonec after the annexation, and some reestablished their firms in the United States and England. Those who remained were eventually sent to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto, and ultimately deported to concentration and death camps. On November 10, 1938 the synagogue was demolished.\n\nPOSTWAR\n\nAfter World War II a small congregation was reestablished in Jablonec, made up mostly of Jews from Subcarpathian Ruthenia; the community became affiliated with Liberec in 1969. In 1969 remains from the cemetery were transferred to the Liberec Jewish Cemetery so that the land could be used for construction.

Between the two World Wars, and during the postwar communist era, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. \n\nThough the cemetery was damaged and vandalized during World War II, and the mortuary was destroyed during the 1950s, a few hundred tombstones are still standing. The oldest of the remaining tombstones dates to 1676. The cemetery is owned by the Jewish community of Brno, which renovated the cemetery in 1997 and has funded its maintenance. It is freely accessible to visitors. \n\nHISTORY\n\nThe Jewish community of Jemnice is probably one of the oldest in Moravia; the community is first mentioned in connection with its suffering during the Armleder massacres of 1336. Tombstones in the Jewish cemetery date back to1362, and there are records from 1369 of a Jewish man's involvement in selling real estate. Sources from 1530 mention Jewish homeowners, and throughout the 16th and 17th centuries transactions in real estate between Jews and gentiles were frequently documented. A synagogue was built in 1648, but burned down in 1752. There were nine Jewish tailors in Jemnice in 1755. \n\nIn 1812 a German-language elementary school was founded, which was run as a government school until 1918. During a fire in 1832 all 28 houses in the Jewish Quarter burned down. Riots broke out in 1866 when the Jews were accused of actively supporting the Prussians.\n\nThere were 24 families living in 11 houses in 1666. In 1754 the number of families who were allowed to live in the town was increased from 30 to 45; consequently, the community's population rose to 263 people (nearly 20% of the total population) in 1781, and 325 people in 1830. \n\nAfter the emancipation of Jews throughout the Austrian Empire in 1848, and the consequent lifting of residence restrictions, Jews began moving to larger towns and cities, seeking greater economic and educational opportunities. Like other similar communities, Jemnice's population began to decline. In 1857 there were 305 Jews living in the town, and 200 in 1869. The population dropped further to102 in 1910, and subsequently 84 in 1921. By 1930 there were only 52 Jews living in the town (1.5% of the total).\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST \n\nIn 1942 the community was deported to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto, after which they were sent to concentration and death camps. Ritual objects from the synagogue were sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague.", "He": "\u05d9\u05de\u05e0\u05d9\u05e6\u05d4 JEMNICE\r\n\r\n(\u05d1\u05d2\u05e8\u05de\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea:

community was actually founded during the 14th century. In 1657 there were 16 Jewish households in the town. A prayer room was opened in 1620, and a synagogue was eventually built in 1784. A fire in 1869, which destroyed the main part of the Jewish Quarter, caused many Jews leave and settle elsewhere. \n\nBetween 1798 and 1848 there were 138 families who were granted permission to live in Jevicko. The Jewish population rose from 776 people in 1830 to 989 in 1848. After the emancipation of Jews throughout the Austrian Empire in 1848, many Jews throughout the region began moving to larger towns and cities, seeking greater educational and economic opportunities. At that point, the Jewish population of Jevicko began to decline; there were 462 Jews living in Jevicko in 1869,and 286 in 1890. \n\nIn 1930 there were 86 Jews in Jevicko (3.1% of the total population). \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nIn 1942 the community was sent to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto, after which they were deported to a number of concentration and death camps. Before the deportation, a number of ritual objects were sent from the synagogue to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nThe synagogue was converted into a Hussite Church in 1953. In 2000 a memorial plaque was added to commemorate the victims of the Holocaust. \n\nThe old cemetery was destroyed in 1945. As of 2009 a car shed is located on the site. The new cemetery was destroyed in 1972, and the site was turned into a park. The park contains a group of representative stones to recall the site's original use as a Jewish cemetery.

Until 1918 Jihlava and the region were part of the Austrian Empire. Between the two World Wars, and during the postwar communist era, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. \n\nThe Jewish cemetery contains over 1,000 tombstones and was reconstructed in 1993. In 1995 a memorial plaque was added to commemorate the victims of the Holocaust. Among those buried in the cemetery are the parents of Gustav Mahler, as well as the composer's two siblings. \n\nIn 1992 a memorial plaque, written in Czech and Hebrew, was placed in the area where the synagogue of Jihlava once stood. This area has been part of the Gustav Mahler Park since 2010. \n\nHISTORY\n\nJews are first mentioned in Jihlava in 1249. In 1345 Charles IV encouraged the municipality to invite Jews to settle there to develop the burgeoning cloth industry. Town records between the years 1359 to 1420 record 2,700 financial transactions between Jews and non-Jews. After a fire in 1353 the Jews, like the other citizens, were released from paying taxes.\n\nIn 1426 Albert V, suspecting that the Jews supported the Hussites, expelled the Jews from the city. They settled in nearby Puklice (Puklitz), Pulice (Pullitz), Pyrnice (Pirnitz), and Trest (Triesch). With no Jews in the city to attend religious services, Jihlava's synagogue was converted into a church in 1511. Between 1708 and 1782 Jews began to be admitted to the town for business purposes only, on the condition that they paid a special tax. In 1837 there were 17 Jews living in Jihlava legally, though more had settled in the city illegally. \n\nAfter the emancipation of Jews throughout the Austrian Empire in1848, and the subsequent lifting of residence restrictions, a community grew rapidly in Jihlava. A prayer room was opened in 1856, a synagogue in 1863, and a cemetery in 1869. Jews were also instrumental in developing the local economy. \n\nIn addition to a chevra kaddisha, the Jewish community supported a Jewish women's group, a chapter of the sports club Maccabi, a Shir Zion choir, and a chapter of the Zionist group Society of Theodor Herzl. \n\nThe community numbered 1,179 people in1869, and in 1921 the Jewish population was 1,180. In 1930 there were 1,025 Jews in Jihlava (3.3% of the total population), 327 of whom declared their nationality as Jewish.\n\nAmong the notable figures from Jihlava are the composer Gustav Mahler (1860-1911), who lived in the town until he turned 17, the poet and politician Louis Furnberg (1909-1957), the director Karel Meinhard (1875-1949), the singer Jara Pospisil (1905-1979), the writer Ernest Sommer (1888-1955), the banker Karel von Morawitz (1846-1914), the anatomist and politician Dr. Julius Tandler (1869-1939), as well as Theodor Herzl's colleague Siegmund Werner (1867-1928). \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nAfter the Sudeten Crisis of 1938, and the Munich Agreement that dissolved the Republic of Czechoslovakia and annexed the Sudeten Region to Nazi Germany, many Jews fled to Jihlava, seeking refuge. However, in March 1939 the region of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews of the region. On November 10, 1938 Jihlava's synagogue was plundered and badly damaged in an attempt to burn it down. Jewish shops were destroyed during another pogrom on April 28, 1939. In 1942 the city's Jews were deported to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto, from which they were sent to a number of concentration and death camps. Before the deportation, a number of ritual objects were sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. \n\nThirty-two Jews from Jihlava survived the war. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nJewish life in Jihlava was temporarily renewed after the war, but between 1947 through 1950 waves of emigration to the west and to Israel depleted the population. In 1950 the damaged synagogue was destroyed. \n", "He": "\u05d9\u05d9\u05d4\u05dc\u05d0\u05d1\u05d4 JIHLAVA\n\n(\u05d1\u05d2\u05e8\u05de\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea IGLAU)\n\n\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8

"UnitText1": {"En": "Jindrichuv Hradec\n\nGerman: Neuhaus\n\nA town in the South Bohemian Region, Czech Republic\n\nUntil 1918, Jindrichuv Hradec and the surrounding region were part of the Austrian Empire. Between the two World Wars, and during the postwar communist era, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe Jewish cemetery has been preserved, with the oldest legible tombstone dating to 1714. In 1990 it was restored by the local youth group Junak. The cemetery also includes a ceremonial hall that still contains the original equipment used to prepare the dead for burial, as well as a tahara and a hearse. \n\nHISTORY\n\nJews began settling in Jindrichuv Hradec at the end of the 13th century. By the 15th century, however, at the request of the local residents, the number of Jewish families in Jindrichuv was limited to four families, and their economic activities were restricted; among the permitted occupations was that of glazier. The cemetery, which was consecrated around 1400, was expanded in 1576.\n\nDuring the 17th century most of the Jews in the area traded in cloth, wool, and tobacco. Six Jewish families (31 people) were recorded as living in the town in 1682, but one family was expelled shortly thereafter since the limit of permitted Jews had been exceeded. Jews who had been expelled from Prague settled in Jindrichuv in 1745. \n\nThe synagogue and many Jewish homes were burned down in a fire in 1801. This would not be the last time the Jewish community of Jindrichuv would suffer. In 1859 the town's Jews were suspected of opposing the Hapsburgs, an accusation that was repeated again during World War I. This led to a number of anti-Jewish riots, both in 1859 and in 1919. \n\nSamuel Judah b. David Kauder served as rabbi in the town from 1822 to 1834. The Jews opened a knitting mill in 1888, which employed 680 workers. \n\nAt a time when Czech nationalism was competing with German nationalism in many areas throughout the Republic of Czechoslovakia, the pro-Czech Jewish Movement (Cechu Zidu), led by Eduard (Leda) Lederer, was very active in Jindrichuv. In 1905 it had the Jewish German-language school in the town closed down. Jewish nationalism also became popular; after World War I the Zionist movement became active in Jindrichuv. \n\nThere were 791 Jews living in the district in 1869 and 617 in 1880. The community itself had 339 members in 1902 and 234 (2.5% of the total population) in 1930, eight of whom declared their nationality as Jewish.\n\nAmong the notable figures from Jindrichuv were the Chorus Master and Conductor of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, Kurt Adler (1907-1977), and the opera singer and composer Karel Berman (1919-1995). \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nThose from the community who had not left by 1942 were deported to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps. Before the community was sent to Terezin, ritual objects from the synagogue were sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague.

Republic\n\nKadan is located on the banks of the Ohre River. Until 1918 Kadan and the region were part of the Austrian Empire. Between the two World Wars, and during the postwar communist era, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Between 1938 and 1945 Kadan was part of the Sudeten Region. \n\nJews are first mentioned in Kadan in 1339 and 1341. Between 1465 and 1517, seven Jews were formally granted citizenship. However, the Jews were expelled in 1520, after the town bought its independence from the local lord. \n\nAfter receiving permission from Frederick II, one Jewish family settled in Kadan in 1624; more followed (mainly from Udlice), in spite of protests from the local townspeople. This new community was expelled in 1650 after the execution of a visiting Jew on charges of killing a Christian child. The body of the child was preserved in a special altar in the church (the church was burned down in 1810). \n\nThere were ten Jewish families in the city in 1724 and nine in 1798. More began settling in the city after the 1848 emancipation of Jews throughout the Austrian Empire and the subsequent repeal of residence restrictions. By 1869 there were a total of 118 Jews in the district and 219 in 1881. The congregation that was founded in 1874 received official approval in 1884 and became a legal community in 1893. \n\nDue to emigration, both within the Republic of Czechoslovakia and beyond, the Jewish population of Kadan began to drop, from 409 in 1910 to 116 (1.5% of the total population) in 1930. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nThe Munich Agreement of September 1938 dissolved the Republic of Czechoslovakia annexed the Sudeten Region, which included Kadan, to Nazi Germany; shortly after the annexation, on November 10, 1938, Kadan's synagogue was burned down. As a result many Jews left the region, often for Bohemia and Moravia, further in the Czech interior. However, by March, 1939 Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the region's Jews.  Beginning in 1941 the Jews were sent to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps, where most were killed. \n", "He": "\u05e7\u05d0\u05d3\u05d0\u05df KADAN\r\n\r\n(\u05d1\u05d2\u05e8\u05de\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea:

Bohemia, was part of the Austrian Empire. Between the two World Wars, and during the postwar communist era, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. \n\nThe Baroque-style synagogue, which had been used as a museum since the 1950s, was renovated in 1994. It houses an ethnographic exhibition depicting Jewish and local folk art. The aron kodesh (holy ark) has been preserved and is in good condition. \n\nThe Jewish cemetery is owned by the Plzen Jewish community. Tombstones date from the 18th through the 20th centuries. The cemetery can be accessed with permission. \n\nHISTORY\n\nOne Jewish family is mentioned as living in Kasejovice in 1570. By the 17th century there was a small community; a cemetery was consecrated in 1669. Also in 1669 a conference of nobles confirmed the statutes of the Boehmische Landesjudenschaft in Kasejovice.\n\nThere were 24 families living in the town in 1721, but a synagogue was not built until 1818. Rabbi Filip Bondy was the community's rabbi between 1859 and 1868 and made history as the first rabbi to preach in the Czech language. \n\nIn 1930 there were only 28 Jews living in Kasejovice.\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nIn 1939 Bohemia and Moravia became protectorates of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews living there. In 1942 all the Jews in the town were deported to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto, and from there they were sent to concentration and death camps, where most perished. Before being sent to Terezin, items from the synagogue were sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. One woman from Kasejovice survived. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nThe community was not reestablished after World War II. The synagogue building was converted into a local museum.

located 16 miles (25km) northwest of Prague. Until 1918 Kladno and the region were part of the Austrian Empire. During the interwar period, and during the postwar communist era, they were part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia.  \n\nOne of the Torah scrolls from Kladno which was sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague during World War II, has been on permanent loan to Congregation Beth El in Fairfield, Connecticut. The Northwood and Pinner Liberal Synagogue (NPLS) of Northwood, Middlesex, UK has a portion of another Torah scroll from Kladno. \n\nThe synagogue that the Jewish community gave to the Czech Hussite National Church during the war still functions as a church. \n\nHISTORY\n\nFor a long time Jews were not permitted to settle in the mining regions of the Austrian Empire, which included Kladno. As a result, it was only at the beginning of the 19th century that the first Jewish family settled in Kladno; by the middle of the 19th century there were three Jewish families living in the city. After the emancipation of Jews throughout the Austrian Empire in 1848, and the subsequent removal of residence restrictions, the Jewish population of Kladno increased considerably. By 1900 there were 430 Jews living in the city.\n\nKladno's first first prayer room was dedicated in 1864. The synagogue was consecrated in 1884, the same year that the Jewish community was officially recognized by the authorities; in 1893 the community would be officially registered as a religious community (kultusgemeinde). The cemetery was consecrated in 1889, about half a mile (900 meters) northeast of the synagogue, near the general cemetery. A modern funeral pavilion was later built in the cemetery in 1938.\n\nThe Jews of Kladno worked as merchants and professionals. Those with capital developed the mines and other resident industries. Some of the local mines were owned by Jews.\n\nDuring the interwar period, the Republic of Czechoslovakia recognized the Jews as a national minority with corresponding rights. Nonetheless, Zionism was not particularly popular in Kladno. Some community members did, however, purchase membership and voting rights for the elections to the 15th Zionist Congress in 1927.  \n\nIn 1921 there were 257 Jews living in Kladno. By 1930, the population had decreased to 210.\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nThe Munich Agreement of September 1938 dissolved the Republic of Czechoslovakia. On March 15, 1939, the German Army entered the Czech territory of Bohemia and Moravia, and the region became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of violence and discrimination against the area's Jews. \n\nIn order to save the synagogue from destruction by the Germans, the Jews of Kladno gave it to the Hussite Church and began holding religious services at the cemetery in the funeral pavilion, which had been built in 1938.\n\nAt the beginning of October, 1941 there were 2,079 Jews were living in the sub-district of Kladno. Between February 6th and 11th, 1942, the Jews were ordered to register so that they could eventually be deported. On the 22nd and 26th of that month, 1,623 Jews from the sub-district of Kladno were expelled in two transports to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and extermination camps, where most were killed. Before the community was sent to Terezin, 278 documents, 17 books, and 170 ritual objects from Kladno were sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. Only 120 Jews from the sub-district survived the war.\n\nA small number of Jews remained in Kladno during the war: those who were exempt from expulsion (mainly Jews married to non-Jews), Jews who happened to be in prison during the deportations, and some who managed to hide. At the end of December, 1944 there were 279 Jews in Kladno and the surrounding area. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nAfter the liberation, 272 Jews were found to be living in Kladno and the surrounding area.  The community was briefly revived, but emigration began to take a toll. In 1948 there were 15 Jews living in Kladno, but only 75 were registered as part of the Jewish community. \n\n\n", "He": "\u05e7\u05dc\u05d0\u05d3\u05e0\u05d5 KLADNO\r\n\r\n\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8

Jewish cemetery has tombstones dating from the second half of the 19th century through the 20th century and includes a special section for children, as well as a memorial for the victims of the Holocaust. The cemetery is owned by the Jewish community of Plzen owns the cemetery and can be accessed with permission. \n\nOne of the Torah scrolls from Klatovy that had been sent to the Central Jewish Museum of Prague during World War II has been on loan to Temple Emanuel of Winston-Salem, North Carolina since 1991. The other nine scrolls are located in the United States and England, including one in the Thanet Community in Ramsgate, and one in the North West Surrey Synagogue. \n\nHISTORY\n\nOne Jewish woman is mentioned in Klatovy in the early 14th century; although no other documentary evidence exists, it is assumed that there was a Jewish community in Klatovy until the 16th century. During the 18th century the rabbinic center for the Klatovy District was in Pobezovice (German: Ronsperg). \n\nAfter 1867, Jews, mostly from the nearby towns of Strazov, Janovice, and Svihov, established a congregation in Klatovy and established a cemetery; in 1873 the community dedicated a synagogue. \n\nThere were 1,345 Jews living in the district in 1869 and 1,305 in 1881. There were 724 Jews (108 families) in Klatovy itself in 1893, and Jews in 14 villages were affiliated with the community. \n\nAt the end of the 19th century Jews established more than three-quarters of the town's factories. \n\nLife could be difficult for the Jews of Klatovy. In 1899 anti-Semitic riots broke out in response to the Hilsner blood libel trial. Later, more riots broke out after a Jewish youth was accused of defiling the statue of a saint. There were more riots in 1919.\n\nDuring World War I there were more than 1,000 Jews living in Klatovy, many of whom were fleeing the war in the east. \n\nKlatovy's Jewish population fluctuated between the two World Wars. While the town continued to attract Jews from the countryside, many others moved to larger towns and cities, seeking more educational and economic opportunities. In 1930 the Jewish population of Klatovy was 344 (2.4% of the total population). \n\nAmong the notable figures from Klatovy were the Czech poet and author Frantisek Gottlieb (1903-1974), the chief rabbi of Bohemia-Moravia Gustav Sicher (1880-1960), and the Czech-Jewish poet Karel Fleischmann (1897-1944). \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nDuring the Sudeten Crisis of 1938, and the subsequent Munich Agreement that dissolved the Republic of Czechoslovakia and annexed the Sudeten region to Nazi Germany, many Jews from the southwestern border of Bohemia fled to Klatovy. However, in March 1939 the region of Bohemia and Moravia, including Klatovy, became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the area's Jews. The synagogue was plundered by Czech fascists on July 15, 1941. The mayor had the attackers arrested and intended to bring them to trial, but German pressure resulted in their release. The synagogue building was then given to the local museum. \n\nIn the fall of 1942 the Germans deported all Jews from Klatovy to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto, and from there they were sent to concentration and death camps where most were killed. Objects from the synagogue, including ten Torah scrolls, were sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague.\n\nPOSTWAR\n\nFifty-five Jews from Klatovy survived the war and returned to Klatovy, though they left within a year or two. A memorial for victims of the Holocaust was dedicated in the Jewish cemetery in 1989.  \n\n", "He": "\u05e7\u05dc\u05d0\u05d8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9

{"En": "Kojetin\n\nGerman: Kojetein\n\nA Moravian town in the Olomouc Region, Czech Republic\n\nThe synagogue, which was used as a warehouse during World War II, was subsequently turned into a Czechoslovak Hussite Church. The building has a memorial plaque dedicated to the victims of the Holocaust. \n\nThe Jewish cemetery is one of the oldest in Moravia and can be accessed by visitors. Though the ceremonial hall was destroyed in the 1970s, many of the tombstones are still standing. The cemetery is owned by the Jewish community of North Olmouc, which pays for its maintenance.  \n\nThe Education and Information Center in Masaryk Square includes a mini-exhibition dedicated to the history of Jewish culture. \n\nFive Torah scrolls were sent from Kojetin to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague during World War II. One of the scrolls is on permanent loan to Temple Bat Yam in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and is displayed as part of the synagogue's Holocaust memorial. A second Torah scroll is used by Maidenhead Synagogue in the United Kingdom. The other scrolls are on permanent loan to Congregation Beth Am in Wheeling, Illinois, B'nai Jacob Congregation in Chicago, Illinois, and Temple Menorah-Knesseth Chai, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. \n\nHISTORY\n\nIt is thought that Jews lived in Kojetin beginning in the 13th century, but the first documentary evidence of their presence in the town dates from 1566, when 52 families lived on the Judengasse (Jewish Street). Records of the cemetery's consecration date to 1574. The synagogue, which had a seating capacity of 300, was renovated in 1614, and again in 1718. During the late 17th century most of the Jews of Kojetin worked as peddlers and cattle growers. \n\n\nIn 1657 only 16 houses were owned by Jews, but the population was growing; during this period the community was absorbing refugees from the Chmielnicki Massacres (1648) as well as some of those who were expelled from Vienna in 1670. Not coincidentally, minhag polin, (the prayer customs derived from Poland), was introduced to the community of Kojetin in 1648. \n\nThe Jewish Quarter had 500 people living in 40 houses in 1727. Life, however, could have been worse; at that point Kojetin was owned by the archbishop of Prague, who treated the Jewish community fairly. It was the Jewish community itself that proved to be a source of drama. During this period there was a scandal in Kojetin, which was mentioned in contemporary rabbinic literature; a Frankist (a follower of the false messiah Jacob Frank) was accused of making the sign of the cross when blessing the community. \n\nIn 1798 the law limited the number of Jewish families who were allowed to live in Kojetin to 76. In 1829 there were 443 Jews in the town, living in 45 houses. Most traded in hides, wax, feathers, and wool. Shortly thereafter, however, in 1848, Jews throughout the Austrian Empire were emancipated, and economic and residence restrictions were lifted. During the period following the emancipation the community flourished. However, beginning in 1860 the population began to decline, as many of its members were attracted to larger towns and cities and the myriad economic and educational opportunities that could be found there. By 1869 the Jewish population of Kojetin had dropped to 162.\n\nOnly 72 Jews (1.1% of the total population), 30 of whom declared their nationality as Jewish, were living in the town in 1930. \n\nAmong the rabbis who served in Kojetin were Eleazer Fleckeles (1779-- 83), a student of Rabbi Ezekiel Landau (the Nodeh b'Yehuda), Jacob Bruell (1843--89), and Richard Feder (1903-06). Notable figures from the town include the scholar David Kaufmann (1852-1899). Additionally, several Jewish family names are connected with Kojetin, including the last names Goitein, Guttein, and Kojeteiner. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nThe region of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany on March, 1939, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the area's Jews. On June 26, 1942 the Jews remaining in Kojetin were deported to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to a number of concentration and death camps where most perished. Before the deportation, objects from the synagogue in Kojetin were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nA small congregation was established after World War II and was affiliated with Olomouc.

Until 1918 Kolin and the region were part of the Austrian Empire. During the interwar period, and during the postwar communist era (until 1993), it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. \n\nApproximately half of the buildings from the original Jewish Quarter have been preserved. This includes the synagogue that was originally built during the 17th century, making it the second oldest synagogue in the Czech Republic. The synagogue has been restored, and has become a cultural center that has preserved the synagogue's interior.  The synagogue has been named a protected monument.  \n\nKolin's two Jewish cemeteries have been preserved. The older cemetery includes the tombstone of Betsal'el ben Yehudah (d. 1599, the son of the Maharal of Prague). This cemetery contains tombstones that date to the first half of the 15th century. A newer cemetery, which was consecrated in 1887, includes a Holocaust memorial. Both cemeteries can be accessed with permission. \n\nOne of the Torah scrolls from Kolin that was sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague during World War II is on permanent loan to the Northwood and Pinner Liberal Synagogue of London. \n\nHISTORY\n\nThe Jewish community of Kolin was one of the four communities included in the Hebrew abbreviation \"Karban\" (Kolin, Roudnice, Bumsla, Nachod), demonstrating its importance (as well as those of the other communities mentioned) as second only to Prague. Town records from 1376-1401 mention 16 Jewish households. By the end of the 15th century there was already an established cemetery. Records from 1512 also include references to an \"old\" synagogue, indicating that it has been built long before. \n\nThe Jews were expelled from the town in 1541, but returned in 1557. This proved to be a temporary respite; they were expelled once again in 1561, and returned yet again in 1564. By 1574 the community was made up of 33 families.  \n\nThroughout the 17th and 18th centuries the Jewish community of Kolin continued to grow; from 138 families in 1718, the community grew to 251 families (1,169 people) in 1793. A synagogue with an ark donated by Samuel Oppenheimer was dedicated in 1696. In a fire in 1796, 43 Jewish houses, housing 205 families, were burned down. \n\nDuring the revolutionary year of 1848, there were 30 Jews from Kolin who joined a national guard unit, sent to aid the revolution in Prague; however, they were forced out of the unit shortly thereafter. That year, Jews throughout the Austrian Empire were emancipated, and the economic and residence restrictions that had heretofore constrained them were lifted. \n\nKolin was home to one of the largest and most prominent yeshivas in Bohemia. The yeshiva was modernized during the 19th century and was called the \"Beit Midrash-Anstalt\" (Institution).  In his visit to the town in 1855, Moses Montefiore was so impressed by the yeshiva that he endowed a foundation for its students. In addition to the yeshiva, other organizations supported by the Jewish community included a chevra kaddisha, a branch of the Maccabi sports club, as well as a number of Zionist, educational, women's, and charitable organizations. \n\nIn 1857 there were 1,347 Jews (16.1% of the total population) living in Kolin. In 1881 the town's Jewish population was 1,148 (9.8% of the total population). \n\nIn 1913 a young Roman Catholic priest, whose last name was Hrachovsky, attempted to levy a blood libel charge against the town's Jews. This was an attempt to cover up his own involvement in the suicide of a young woman whom the priest had impregnated.  \n\nBetween the two World Wars many Jews in Kolin supported the Czecho-Jewish movement. This movement was established in 1919 in order to promote and embrace the assimilation of the Jews into the Czech language and culture. \n\nAmong the rabbis who lived or served in Kolin were Jacob Illowy (1746-1781), Eleazar b. Eleazar Kallir (1781-1802), and Daniel Frank (1839-1860). The last rabbi to serve in the community was Richard Feder. Among the notable figures from Kolin were the Viennese philosopher, scientist, and inventor Joseph Popper-Lynkeus, the Jewish national politician Ludwig Singer, the Czech poet and literary critic Otokar Fischer, and the industrialists Isidor, Julius, and Ignaz Petschek.\n\nThere were 430 Jews (2.3% of the total population) living in the town in 1930 (2.3%). \n\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nAfter the Munich Agreement of September, 1938 the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved, and the Sudeten Region was annexed to Nazi Germany. At that point, many Jews began arriving in Kolin from the Sudeten region, hoping to flee the Nazi regime. At that point life in Kolin was seemingly stable. Beginning in March, 1939 Prague supplied the town with kosher meat. About 600 Jews organized for collective emigration, and were even given support by the French government to establish a settlement in New Caledonia. The outbreak of World War II, however, in September 1939, halted these plans. The region of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, and a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews of the region began. In January, 1940, Jewish shops were confiscated, three months before the same would happen to Jewish stores throughout the rest of Bohemia and Moravia. Jewish women were forced to work in a local soap factory. The cemetery was damaged by an aircraft bombardment. \n\nBeginning on June 10, 1942, three transports left from Kolin to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto; a total of 2,202 Jews from Kolin and other areas were deported on these transports. From Terezin, they were deported to a number of concentration and death camps, where a total of 2,098 perished, 475 of whom were from Kolin itself; 104 Jews from Kolin survived the war. Before the deportation to Terezin, ritual objects and synagogue equipment was sent from Kolin to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nA small community was reestablished in 1945. By 1948 there were 98 acknowledged Jews living in the town, and an additional118 who did not officially acknowledge their Jewishness. The community, however, was ultimately short-lived. By 1966 there were only 15 Jews left in the community.  \n\nA memorial to the victims of the Holocaust was erected in 1950.\n\nIn 1969 the Jewish community of Kolin became affiliated with the Jewish community of Prague. In 1970 it was dissolved. The last acknowledged Jewish resident of Kolin died in 1981. \n\n", "He": "\u05e7\u05d5\u05dc\u05d9\u05df KOLIN\r\n\r\n(\u05d1\u05de\u05e7\u05d5\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05d9\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd

Vltavou, Czech Republic\n\nUntil 1918 Kolodeje and the region were part of the Austrian Empire. Between the two World Wars, and during the postwar communist era until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. \n\nThe Jewish cemetery is owned by the Jewish community of Prague. It can be accessed with permission.  \n\nHISTORY\n\nThe settlement of Jews at Kolodeje began with a few families who settled in the village under the protection of a local noble, Baron Brandstein; a protection letter from 1569 has been preserved.\n\nIn 1681 Jews were expelled from the nearby town Tyn nad Vltavou (German: Moldautein) after being accused of spreading the plague. These Jews arrived at Kolodeje and began to establish a community. They were followed in 1684 by more refugees from Tyn who had been expelled by the Archduke of Prague. The local lord allowed this community to build a synagogue, which was dedicated in 1697, and also built them ten additional homes. The community also established a school and a cemetery. Most of the village's Jews worked as peddlers, some of whom traded in Upper Austria, while others worked as craftsmen.   \n\nIn 1721 there were 35 Jewish families (160 people) living in the village.\n\nKolodeje became a rabbinic center for the entire district. Additionally, the rabbinates of the Budejovice Ceske and Tabor districts were also based for some time at Kolodeje. Rabbi Abraham Kauder was appointed as the rabbi of Kolodeje, and served between 1807 and 1834 before he was appointed as the Chief Rabbi of Prague .In addition to the rabbis who came to serve at Kolodeje, the community also employed a cantor. \n\nIn 1852 there were 94 Jewish families living in Kolodeje. \n\nThe community of Kolodeje had a chevra kaddisha and a number of charity organizations. There was also a Jewish elementary school. Dozens of Jewish children attended the local Jewish elementary school, but in 1876 the school was turned into a general state school because of insufficient Jewish children. \n\nJews throughout the Austrian Empire were emancipated in 1848, and economic and residence restrictions were lifted. As a result, many began to move from villages to larger towns and cities, seeking greater economic and educational opportunities. Like other similar communities, the Jewish population of Kolodeje began to decline. In 1869 there were still 258 taxpaying members, but by 1876 the Jewish school was turned into a general state school due to lack of enrollment. In 1904 there were only 35 Jews left in Kolodeje. Nevertheless, the community's district offices continued to function until World War II, and they kept the community\u2019s register from the year 1784 until 1944.\n\nIn 1930 there were 8 Jews living at Kolodeje.\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of September 1938, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved. Shortly thereafter, in March 1939, the region of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the region's Jews. Beginning in 1941, Czech Jews were deported to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps, where most perished. Before being sent to Terezin, 80 documents, 100 books and 180 ritual objects from the Jewish community of Kolodeje were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague.\n\nPOSTWAR\n\nAfter the war the school building was turned into a private home. It was later declared a historic site and renamed Kisovna, after the school's last teacher whose last name was Kis. The Jewish cemetery was also declared a historic site and repaired in 1991.

From 1938 until 1945 Kraslice was one of the municipalities in the Sudeten Region. \n\nDue to residence restrictions, Jews were forbidden from settling in Kraslice until 1848, when the Jews of the Austrian Empire were emancipated and granted full civil rights. Loewel Loewenstein, a tax collector, was the first Jew to settle at Kraslice in 1852. In 1855, there were still only 5 Jewish families in the town. It was not until the 20th century that a substantial community was established in the town, though the Jewish population was always quite small. In 1913, a small community, Adat Israel, was established. A prayer room was created in the home of Dr. Wilhelm Bloch. Jewish children attended the general school and received supplementary religious lessons from the rabbi of the community of Sokolov (German: Falkenau). In 1921 there were 65 Jews living in Kraslice.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century the Jews of Kraslice worked as merchants, factory owners (a weaving factory employed a number of townspeople), physicians, lawyers, teachers, railway inspectors, tax inspectors, umbrella manufacturers, and furriers. During the 20th century the Jews of Kraslice worked as physicians, lawyers, industrialists, printers, teachers, and clerks. \n\nThe non-Jewish inhabitants of Kraslice generally treated the Jews with suspicion and kept their distance. Kraslice's Jews were often harassed; when the price of sugar was raised, the windows of Jewish homes were shattered. A Jewish doctor, who had a clinic in the town, would carry a loaded gun while he worked.\n\nThe Republic of Czechoslovakia recognized the Jews as a national minority, with specific rights. This prompted many Jews to become interested in Jewish nationalism, particularly Zionism. The Jewish community of Kraslice became active in the Zionist movement. Before elections to the 15th Zionist Congress in 1927, the Jews of Kraslice purchased membership and voting rights. In 1937 there were 22 members of the community who took part in the elections to the 29th Zionist Congress. \n\nIn 1930 there were 88 Jews living in Kraslice.\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nThe Munich Agreement of 30 September 1938 annexed the Sudeten Region, which included Kraslice, to Nazi Germany. Most of the Jews living in the Sudeten Region fled to Bohemia and Moravia. However, in March 1939 the rest of the Czech lands became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the area's Jews. Beginning at the end of 1941, Czech Jews were deported to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps, where most were killed.  \n\n", "He": "\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0\u05e1\u05dc\u05d9\u05e6\u05d4

surrounding region were part of the Austrian Empire. Between the two World Wars, and during the postwar communist era (until 1993), it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. \n\nOf the original 36 houses that stood in the Jewish Quarter, 31 have survived, many of which date to the 17th century. Part of the 18th-century wall separating the Jewish Quarter from the rest of the town can also be found under the parish church. \n\nThe new Jewish cemetery, consecrated in 1924, was badly damaged by the Nazis and only five tombstones have been preserved. This cemetery includes a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, as well as remains from the old Jewish cemetery that were transferred to the new Jewish cemetery in 1997. This cemetery is open to the public. \n\nA memorial sculpture dedicated to the destruction of the Jewish community and the synagogue can be found near the Kromeriz community center. \n\nThe Torah scrolls that were sent from the Jewish community of Kromeriz to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague during World War II are on permanent loan to the following synagogues in the United States: Temple Beth Israel in Longboat Key, Florida, Temple Beth David in Westminster, California, Temple Shearith Israel in Ridgefield, Connecticut, Shaare Tefila Congregation in Silver Spring, Maryland, Mizpah Congregation in Chattanooga Tennessee, Temple Sholom in Bridgewater, New Jersey, Temple Sinai in North Miami Beach, Florida, and Temple Emeth in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.  \n\nHISTORY\n\nThe Jewish community of Kromeriz was among the oldest in Europe. In 1322 the bishop of Olomouc (German: Olmuetz) was given permission to allow one Jew to settle in the town. A community developed shortly tehreafter under the protection of the bishop. The Jewish community of Kromeriz would remain under the protection of successive bishops until the emancipation of Jews throughout the Austrian Empire in 1848 and the subsequent removal of residence restrictions. In fact, in acknowledgment of the protection that the community was offered for so many years, the synagogue and community house displayed the episcopal coat of arms with a cross and cardinal's hat. \n\nEarly records from the Jewish community indicate that a Jewish person brought a lawsuit against a non-Jew in the town court. After conflicts with their non-Jewish neighbors, the Jewish community moved to another part of the town in 1546. In 1642, during the Thirty Years' War, the community was destroyed by the Swedes, an event written about and mourned in several contemporary selichot (penitential prayers). Shortly thereafter, the reestablished community absorbed many refugees from the Chmielnicki massacres of1648; an additional eight families who had been expelled from Vienna in 1670 settled in the town under the protection of the bishop. By 1676 there were 27 Jewish families living in the town. \n\nDuring the 17th century Kromeriz was considered to be the most important and affluent community in Moravia, second only to Mikulov (German: Nikolsburg). From 1689 until 1697 it was the main headquarters of the general rabbinate. \n\nDuring the 18th century, however, the community became impoverished and many of its members left. After protracted legal proceedings that began in 1785, the community was required to give up the site of its old cemetery in 1882 (a new cemetery had been opened in 1850). A blood libel in 1889, and again in 1896, led to unrest within the town. \n\nA new synagogue was dedicated in 1910. The old synagogue, which was originally built in the late 17th century, was torn down in 1921. A new cemetery was also consecrated in 1924.  \n\nIn 1829, while Jews were still subject to residence restrictions and the number of Jews permitted to live in Kromeriz was limited, the Jewish community of Kromeriz was home to 106 families (546 people). By 1880, after the residence restrictions had been lifted, there were 783 Jews living in the town. Shortly thereafter, however, Jews throughout the region began moving to larger towns and cities, seeking greater economic and educational opportunities. As a result, Jewish populations in places like Kromeriz began to decline. In 1900 there were 611 Jews living in Kromeriz, and the population dropped further to 390 in 1921. In 1930 the Jewish population of Kromeriz was 382 (12% of the total population).\n\nAmong the rabbis who served the community were Menachem Mendel Krochmal (1636-1642), Issachar Berush Eskeles (1710-1719), and the historian Adolf Frankl-Gruen (1877-1911). Notable figures from the town include the scholars Joseph Weiss and Emanuel Baumgarten (1828-1908), the historian Max Grunfeld (1856-1933), and the art historian Adolf Donath (1876-1937).\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST \n\nIn March 1939, a few months before the outbreak of World War II, the regions of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the region's Jews. Among the anti-Jewish laws that was quickly enacted was a prohibition against shehita-kosher slaughtering. The Nazis blew up and destroyed the synagogue in Kromeriz and badly damaged the new cemetery. In 1942 the community was deported to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps, where most were killed. Before the community's deportation, a number of ritual objects and synagogue equipment was sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague.  \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nA small congregation, affiliated with the town of Kyjov, was briefly reestablished after the war\n\nA memorial to the Nazi victims of the Holocaust was unveiled in the new Jewish cemetery in 1962. In 1997 bones from the old Jewish cemetery were moved to the new Jewish cemetery. \n\nIn 1994 a memorial was unveiled commemorating the Jewish community and the destruction of the synagogue by the Nazis. \n", "He": "\u05e7\u05e8\u05d5\u05de\u05d9\u05d9\u05d6'\u05d9\u05d6' KROMERIZ\r\n\r\n(\u05d1\u05d2\u05e8\u05de\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea: KREMSIER)\r\n\r\n\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8 \u05e0\u05e4\u05d4

the Central Bohemian Region, Czech Republic\n\nKutna Hora is located about 37 miles (60km) southeast of Prague. In fact, from the 13th until the 16th century it competed with Prague culturally, politically, and economically. Until 1918 Kutna Hora was part of the Austrian Empire. Between the two World Wars, and during the postwar communist era (until 1993), it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Since 1995 the city center has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. \n\nThe former synagogue building in Kutna Hora has served as a Czechoslovak Hussite church since 1949. Its exterior has been preserved, including a large Star of David located on top of the building. A monument was built in front of the former synagogue to commemorate the local Jewish victims of the Nazis. In 2012 a memorial plaque was also unveiled at the former synagogue. \n\nHISTORY\n\nAs a designated royal town, Jews were forbidden from settling within Kutna Hora. It was only after the emancipation of Jews throughout the Austrian Empire in 1848, and the subsequent removal of residence restrictions, that Jews were able to settle in the city. \n\nBefore they were allowed to settle in Kutna Hora the Jews who came to trade in the city lived in smaller towns in the area. Malin was among the surrounding neighborhoods that had a significant Jewish community. During the first half of the 19th century there were 24 Jewish families living in Malin, and Malin also had many of the Jewish communal institutions that would eventually be used by the burgeoning Jewish community in Kutna Hora. Beginning in 1802, religious services were held at a prayer house built by Hirsch Fischer in his distillery. In 1847 the prayer house was expanded. In 1856 the distillery, with the prayer house in it, was completely destroyed in a fire and until the distillery was rebuilt, services were held in a private house. Hirsch Eisler and his brother established a Jewish religious society in Malin in 1864, and members came from Jewish communities throughout the area. Because the society was not recognized as an organized community, and therefore could not impose dues on its members, its activities were funded by voluntary contributions. Indeed, 33 families contributed to the construction of a synagogue in Malin. However, synagogue construction took four years (1859-1863), due to difficulties in raising the necessary funds. The eventual synagogue building also held a mikvah and an apartment for the cantor. It would serve the community until the end of World War I; in 1922 the building would be sold to the Czech sports organization Sokol. In 1865 Wolf Steiner was elected as the community's leader. \n\nAnother Jewish community in the area was located in Malesov, which has records of a Jewish community dating to 1719, when approximately 15 Jewish families and a rabbi were living in the town. During the first half of the 19th century the number of the families living in Malesov grew to 20 (140 people). A cemetery was probably opened during the 18th century and expanded during the second half of the 19th century; this cemetery also eventually served the Jews of Kutna Hora. Most of the Jewish houses were located on the Jewish Street. The Jewish Street was also home to a Jewish school, a synagogue that was built around the middle of the 19th century, and, during World War I, an Orthodox prayer house that served Jewish refugees from Galicia.\n\nJews lived in Zbraslavice, another town in the area, for approximately 300 years. By 1692 the community had a Jewish cemetery. A wooden synagogue served the community of Zbraslavice for about 200 years until a brick synagogue was built in 1832. \n\nAs mentioned previously, Jews settled at Kutna Hora during the second half of the 19th century, after the emancipation. They were thought as being in favor of German culture, which caused tension and led to pogroms in 1861 led by Czech nationalists. In 1871 the Jews of Kutna Hora founded a religious society that consisted of 14 members. A prayer house was opened at Kutna Hora in 1881; until then, most went to Malin for services. An actual synagogue building was consecrated in 1902.\n\nIn 1893, when the number of Jews at Kutna Hora had reached 169, the community was officially organized. A committee was elected, with W. Beran as the leader of the community and Rabbi A. Rubinstein as the rabbi. Among the subsequent rabbis who served the community Kutna Hora were Rabbi Emanuel Steiner, Rabbi Solomon Podvinec, Rabbi Maxim Stransky, and Rabbi Shimon Abeles. The community's last rabbi was Gabriel Gottlieb, who served between 1912 and 1918. The institutions that served the community included a chevra kaddisha and a women's society. Most Jews worked as traders, while others owned factories (the Teller family owned a sugar factory and all of their employees were Jewish) or worked as professionals. \n\nWith the removal of residence restrictions during the second half of the 19th century, Jews throughout the Czech lands began moving to larger towns and cities, seeking greater economic and educational opportunities. As a result, the populations and importance of the small towns around Kutna Hora declined, and those communities began to affiliate with the community of Kutna Hora. \n\nKutna Hora played an important role during the Hilsner Affair of 1899-1900, a famous blood libel case when Leopold Hilsner, a Jew from eastern Bohemia, was accused of murdering a young woman. Kutna Hora was the site of Hilsner's first trial, which took place between September 12-16, 1899. At the end of the trial, Hilsner was convicted of aggravated murder. The verdict led to a number of riots that broke out throughout Bohemia and Moravia. Hilsner's lawyer appealed to the Supreme Court in Vienna; the original verdict was nullified, but Hilsner was again found guilty after a trial that took place in the southern Bohemian city of Pisek. He was ultimately pardoned just before World War I by Emperor Charles I. \n\nDuring World War I many Jews from Kutna Hora enlisted in the army. In fact, after the war a commemoration statue was erected in the city in memory of the Jewish soldiers who were killed in battle. \n\nDuring the interwar period, the Republic of Czechoslovakia recognized the Jews as a national minority, with attendant rights.  Zionism became particularly active in Kutna Hora during this time, and a branch of the Zion society was established.  \n\nIn 1921 the Jewish community of Kutna Hora numbered 312, of whom 188 lived in the town itself. In 1930 there were 140 Jews living in Kutna Hora and less than 10 living in Malin. Only 3 of Kutna Hora's 140 Jews declared their nationality as Jewish; the rest considered themselves to be Czech. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nAs a result of the Munich Agreement of September, 1938, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved. Shortly thereafter, on March 15, 1939 Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews living there. Between April and June of 1942, most of the Jews of Kutna Hora and the vicinity were deported to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps where most were killed. Meanwhile, 70 documents, 35 books, and 105 ritual objects were sent from Kutna Hora to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nAfter the war Jews did not return to Kutna Hora. The synagogue building of Kutna Hora was turned into a Czechoslovak Hussite church and the synagogue building at Zbraslavice was turned into a garage. The synagogue building in Malin was demolished by the authorities during the 1960s, and Malesov's synagogue was destroyed in 1987.", "He": "\u05e7\u05d5\u05d8\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4

Austrian Empire. Between the two World Wars, and during the postwar communist era (until 1993), it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. \n\nKyjov was the only royal city in which Jews were permitted to live, albeit with restrictions. A synagogue was built in 1506 (it would be demolished in 1851). The rights of Kyjov's Jews were protected by a 1613. In 1650 Jews were able to remain in Kyjov while those who lived in communities that had not been in existence before 1618 were expelled. Though the town's residents petitioned several times for the Jews of Kyjov to be expelled, the royal charter was obeyed. In 1651 the Jews of Kyjov were permitted to distill spirits. By 1688 there were 12 Jewish homes in Kyjov.  \n\nIn 1727 the Jews were segregated into a Jewish Quarter. Later, after the emancipation of Jews throughout the Austrian Empire in 1848 and residence restrictions were lifted, the Jewish Quarter remained as an autonomous political community until the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918. \n\nDuring World War I a large refugee camp near Kyjov was administered by the community. After the war the Czechoslovak central authorities prevented the local authorities from expelling its inhabitants and they were allowed to stay. \n\nSeventy-four Jewish families were permitted to live in Kyjov under the familiants law that governed residence restrictions for Jews. The community grew from 427 in 1830 to 510 in 1848. In 1869 there were 884 Jews in the community, and 820 in 1890. In 1900 there were 620 Jews living in Kyjov. In 1930 the community numbered 319 (7% of the total population). \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nThe Munich Agreement of September 1938 resulted in the dissolution of the Republic of Czechoslovakia and the annexation of the Sudeten Region to Nazi Germany. The refugee camp that had once served those fleeing from war-torn areas during World War I was reopened for 670 refugees from the Sudeten Region and for refugees from Vienna. Shortly thereafter, however, in March 1939, the area of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews living there. The Nazis used the refugee camp to assemble all the Jews from Kyjov and the surrounding district. Early in 1943 four transports deported a total of 2,852 people from the refugee camp to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps, where most perished. Ritual objects and synagogue equipment were sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. The Nazis destroyed the synagogue, the two Jewish cemeteries, and all remnants of the Jewish Quarter. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nAfter the Holocaust, Kyjov became the center for the Jewish communities in the region, with authority over the communities of Hodonin, Holesov, Kromeriz, Uhersky Brod, and Vsetin. In 1959 there were about 300 Jews in all of these communities combined. The community of Kyjov also cared for the community of Bzenec, and opened a prayer room in the town in 1956.  \n\nIn 1956 a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust was dedicated in the cemetery.

"UnitText1": {"En": "Kynsperk nad Ohri\n\nGerman: Koenigsberg an der Eger\n\nA town in the Sokolov District, Karlovy Vary Region, Czech Republic\n\nKynsperk is located on the Ohre River. Until 1918 it was part of the Austrian Empire. Between the two World Wars, and during the postwar communist era until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Between 1938 and 1945 Kynsperk was one of the municipalities in the Sudeten Region.\n\nThe Jewish cemetery is owned by the Jewish community of Plzen. The cemetery contains a special section for children. \n\nHISTORY \n\nFrom the beginning, Kynsperk was a market town for the entire region. Jewish merchants came to the town to conduct business, but were only permitted to settle in the town beginning in the 14th century. In 1350 riots broke out against the Jews at Cheb. Those who were killed in the riots were buried at Kynsperk, while those who managed to escape found refuge in the town. Anti-Semitism was prevalent from the time that Jews began living in the town. More than once the leaders of Kynsperk approached the leaders of the town of Cheb and asked to send Kynsperk's Jews to Cheb.  \n\nIn 1618 six Jewish families lived in Kynsperk and by 1685 a Jewish Quarter had been established. \n\nIn 1706 a fire broke out at Kynsperk. Legend has it that the fire subsided when the rabbi drew a circle around a burning house, threw a loaf of bread into it, prayed. A Jewish man named Joel also evidently helped save the town during the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). When the Swedes blockaded the town, the town's leaders, who had not managed to raise enough money to essentially buy the town's freedom from the siege, approached Joel who put his wealth at their disposal. \n\nDuring the middle of the 17th century most of the Jews of Kynsperk worked as merchants. One family owned half of an agricultural farm.  During the 18th century the Jews traded in wool and haberdashery. Some also worked as distillers, or as army suppliers in the district of Cheb.  \n\nA cemetery was consecrated around the beginning of the17th century and also served Jews from the neighboring villages. In 1734 prayer services were conducted in a small room in a private home; a prayer house was established around 1770. A synagogue was built at the beginning of the 19th century and also served Jews from the neighboring villages, including Katzengruen and Pochlovitz. A source from 1739 references a mikveh. A kosher butcher (shokhet) and a Jewish school are mentioned in sources dating from the end of the 18th century. The community also had its own chevra kaddisha.\n\nIn 1732 a law was enacted that forbade Jews from building houses, schools or cemeteries. They were also forbidden from cultivating fields, or acquiring property and land. However, in spite of these restrictions, their importance in maintaining the local market, and especially the annual fairs, was clear; later, in 1844, the entire annual fair had to be postponed after it had inadvertently been set for Yom Kippur.  \n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century a number of anti-Jewish restrictions were put into place. Jews were barred from trading n Kynsperk. In 1801 eight Jewish families were given one month to leave the town. In 1802 it became forbidden to lease houses to Jews. Eleven Jewish families were thrown out of the town in 1804; only a few families were permitted to stay, among them the family of Rabbi Dattelzweig. In 1825 a new regulation was passed, allowing Jews to celebrate the holiday of Purim only behind closed doors. The town\u2019s Jews were also forbidden to provide lodging to Jews from other places. However, in spite of these restrictions, the Jews of Kynsperk did illegally bury Jews from other places, and offered their homes to Jewish travelers. Additionally, in 1814 the community was permitted to expand the cemetery and build a burial pavilion, though on the condition that only local Jewish residents would be buried there. \n\nIn 1840 there were140 Jews living in Kynsperk in 20 houses.\n\nBeginning at the end of the 18th century Jewish youth were eligible to be drafted into the army, though the draft could be waived for payment. However, in 1848, when the Czechs revolted against the Austrian monarchy, 11 Jews from Kynsperk joined the national guard. \n\nJews throughout the Austrian Empire were emancipated in 1848, and the vast majority of the economic and residence restrictions that had affected the Jews were repealed. Jewish life in Kynsperk temporarily began to flourish. The synagogue was renovated in 1878. A Jewish school was founded in 1851, with German as the language of instruction; the school taught Hebrew, the Bible, geography, arithmetic, drawing, and \"homeland studies.\" In 1859 there were 163 Jews living in the community and 33 children enrolled in the school. Among the school's teachers were the town's cantors and kosher butchers. After the emancipation, the Jews also began enjoying a wider range of economic options. A Jewish man set up a weaving mill for cotton fabrics in Kynsperk. Emmanuel Gottlieb's furniture factory in Kynsperk was known all over the country.\n\nThe emancipation also allowed the Jews of Kynsperk to participate in local political and public life. A delegate from the Jewish community joined the district council. Anti-Semitism, however, remained a powerful force within the town. As a result of anti-Semitic lobbying, the furniture factory, which provided jobs for many of the townsmen, was closed down; the building was bought shortly thereafter by another Jewish resident who set up a glue factory. In 1897 there was an attempt to close down the Jewish cemetery; the courts, which considered the case for two years, ultimately ruled in favor of the community.\n\nIn 1886 the community consisted of 18 families. Albert Levi was elected as head of the community, a position he held for 45 years until the community was dissolved. Among the community\u2019s rabbis were: Ignaz Tschassni, Ignaz Weiss, Marcus Zickler and the community's last rabbi, Jacob Beer, who was appointed in 1888 and died in 1925.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century Jews began to move to the larger towns and cities, seeking greater economic and educational opportunities. The Jewish population of Kynsperk declined and, ultimately, in 1930 it became affiliated with the Jewish community of Cheb. All of the community\u2019s property was transferred to Cheb, except for the ritual objects, which remained in Kynsperk's synagogue. After the merger was finalized, the community of Cheb provided the Jews of Kynsperk with a religion teacher and a cantor. The Kynsperk community was also allowed 2- 3 representatives in the Cheb community\u2019s committee. \n\nIn 1932 the community of Kynsperk was disbanded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "He":

in the Karlovy Vary Region, Czech Republic\n\nJews lived in Lazne Kynzvart as early as the beginning of the 14th century; the cemetery dates to 1405. In 1430, after it had absorbed a number of Jews who had been expelled from Cheb (Eger), the community numbered 180 families. \n\nAccording to legend, the synagogue was renovated in 1608 with the help of Jesuits whom the Lazne Kynzvart Jews had helped when they were being persecuted by the Hussites during the Reformation. Beginning at the end of the 17th century, and for the next 200 years, Lazne Kynzvart was the center of the district rabbinate.\n\nIn 1724 there were nine Jewish families in the town. \n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century the Jewish community was under the protection of Prince Metternich. In 1848 Jews throughout the Austrian Empire were emancipated, and residence restrictions were lifted. As a result, Jews began moving to larger towns and cities in search of greater economic and educational opportunities. Many Jews from Lazne Kynzvart left for Marienbad, among other areas, and by the end of the 19th century the Jewish population of Lazne Kyzvart had declined significantly.  \n\nIn 1902 there were 51 Jews living in Lazne Kyzvart itself, as well as in the surrounding villages. By 1933 there were only 4 families living in the town and the surrounding area.\n\nThe Koenigswarter banking family was from Lazne Kynzvart. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST \n\nIn March, 1938 the region of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of violence and discrimination against the area's Jews. At this point the last of Lazne Kynzvart's Jews left the town. Their abandoned homes, as well as Lazne Kynzvart's synagogue, were desecrated and destroyed in 1938. Nazis took tombstones from the cemetery and placed them, face up, to pave the road. Beginning in 1941 Jews throughout the Czech lands were sent to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were deported to concentration and death camps, where most perished.  \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nSome tombstones were removed from the cemetery and sent to the Jewish cemetery in Marianske Lazne (Marienbad). In 2005 the town observed the 600th anniversary of the cemetery. \n", "He": "\u05dc\u05d0\u05d6\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e7\u05d9\u05e0\u05d6'\u05d5\u05d5\u05d0\u05e8\u05d8 LAZNE

Reichenberg \n\nThe fifth-largest city in the Czech Republic\n\nUntil 1918 Liberec and the surrounding region were part of the Austrian Empire. Between the two World Wars, and during the postwar communist era, until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Between 1938 and 1945 it was part of the Sudeten Region.\n\nA reconciliation building stands on the site of the synagogue that was destroyed in November, 1938. The building includes a synagogue for the Jewish community of northern Bohemia. The building also houses a public library. \n\nIn 2008 a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust was unveiled in the Jewish cemetery. The cemetery itself, which was neglected during the communist era, was returned to the Jewish community in 1992, beginning a period of restoration. The cemetery includes special sections for children, suicides, and refugees. It also holds the remains transported from the Jewish cemetery of Jablonec nad Nisou, which was razed in 1968 to make room for construction. The Jewish cemetery if Liberec can be accessed with permission. \n\nHISTORY \n\nThere were 60 Jews living in Liberec in 1582, though at a certain point Jews were forbidden from living in the town. There was no community in the city during the 18th and first half of the 19th century. Although there were 57 Jews living in Liberec in 1811, their residence there was illegal; since 1776 Jews were only permitted in the town during the week. In 1799 and 1810 all of the city's Jews were evicted from private homes and provided with special inns to stay at when they arrived in the city for business purposes. In spite of these restrictions, Jews did manage to contribute significantly to the local economy; Jewish wool dealers in particular, including Simon von Laemel, were among the developers of the textile industry. \n\nIn 1848 Jews throughout the Austrian Empire were emancipated, and residence and economic  restrictions were subsequently lifted. At that point Jews began to (legally) settle in the city. A congregation was founded in 1863 and a synagogue was dedicated in 1889. In addition to the synagogue, there was also a prayer room, Achdus Yisroel, that served the city's Orthodox community. \n\nIn 1912 there were 1,240 Jews in the city (3.4% of the total population) and in 1930 there were 1,392 (3.6%). \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nThe Munich Agreement of September 1938 resulted in the dissolution of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, as well as the annexation of the Sudeten Region to Nazi Germany; Liberec became the capital of the newly formed Reichsgau of the Sudetenland. After the annexation, almost all of the Jews fled Liberec. The 30 who remained were eventually arrested. Liberec's synagogue was destroyed on Nobember 10, 1938.\n\nPOSTWAR \n\nA Jewish community was refounded after the war, made up mostly of Jews from Subcarpathian Ruthenia. By 1946 there were 1,211 Jews living in the city, including 37 who were originally from Liberec.\n  \nIn 1954 a memorial plaque for Holocaust victims was erected. This plaque was restored in 1987, along with the prayer room.

the older cemeteries has a small number of tombstones that are still standing. The older cemetery was restored during the 1990s by Jewish groups from abroad. The new cemetery that was opened in 1883 has a large number of tombstones dating from the late 19th century to the 20th century, as well as the ruins of the pre-burial house. Both cemeteries can be accessed freely. \n\nHISTORY\n\nSources from 1540 mention a synagogue, though at that point Jews had been living in the town for at least a century. In fact, in 1567 a third Jewish cemetery was opened (a fourth would be opened in 1883). At that time most of Lipnik's Jews were engaged in textile production and in importing livestock from Poland. In 1570 the Jews were granted residence rights in Lipnik in perpetuity, in exchange for payment. By 1665 there were 40 Jewish families living in Lipnik. In 1788 the number of Jewish families permitted by law to live in Lipnik was 255. \n\nThe rabbis who served the community included Moses Simson Bacharach (1632-1644), who composed a selichah (penitential prayer) commemorating the destruction of the town by Swedish troops in 1643, during the Thirty Years' War, Isaac Eulenburg (1652-1657), and Isaiah b. Shabbetai Sheftel Horowitz (1658-1673). Under rabbis Baruch Fraenkel-Teomim (1802-1828), Solomon Guetsch (1832-1854), and Moses Bloch (1856-1877), the local yeshiva attracted students from all over Europe. Rabbi F. Hillel (1892--1928) wrote a history of the community. Rabbi Binyamin Wolf Eiger (1756-1795), the uncle and teacher of Rabbi Akiva Eiger, also served as the community's rabbi, and taught in the yeshiva. \n\nIn 1794 there were 975 Jews living in Lipnik. The Jewish population grew to 1,259 in 1830. In 1848 Jews throughout the Austrian Empire were emancipated, and the economic and residence restrictions under which they had lived were lifted. Two years later the community was constituted as a political community, and by 1857 there were 1,687 Jews living in Lipnik. \n\nThe Jewish population growth in Lipnik was temporary, as Jews throughout the region began moving to larger towns and cities, seeking more economic and educational opportunities. In 1880 there were 485 Jews and 453 non-Jews living in the town. In 1900 294 Jews and 711 non-Jews lived in Lipnik. By 1921 only 212 Jews remained in the town and in 1930 the community numbered 154 (2% of the total population). \n\nAmong the notable figures from Lipnik were the industrialists David and Wilhelm Guttmann, who established an institution for the poor in 1903, in their mother's house. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nIn 1942 the Jews of Lipnik were deported to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to a number of concentration and death camps. Before being sent to Terezin, ritual objects and synagogue equipment was sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nJewish communal life was not renewed after the war. In 1948 the synagogue was turned into a Hussite Church. Though the building itself is standing, its appearance has been significantly altered.

"Litomerice\n\nGerman: Leitmeritz \n\nA town in the Czech Republic\n\nFor information about the town of Lovosice (German: Lobositz), see below\n\nLitomerice is located at the intersection of the Labe and Ohre Rivers (German: Elbe and Eger Rivers), approximately 40 miles (64km) northwest of Prague. Until 1918 Litomerice was part of the Austrian Empire. Between the two World Wars, and during the postwar communist era, until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Between 1938 and 1945 Litomerice was one of the municipalities of the Sudeten Region. \n\nThe Jewish section of the local cemetery has tombstones dating from the late 19th century through the 20th century. It also includes a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust. \n\nHISTORY \n\nJews are mentioned in the town's founding charter (1057) as salt merchants, making Litomerice the first town in Bohemia, after Prague, to mention Jews. By 1411 a Jewish Quarter had been established. In 1514 the city council protected its poor Jewish artisans from the financial demands of non-local lords, and in 1529 the Bohemian royal authorities demanded that the town's mayor provide protection for the Jews. \n\nIn 1540 Ferdinand I voided a permit that allowed the Jews to trade freely in wine, and the following year, after a massacre, the Jews were expelled from the town. Litomerice was granted the privilege forbidding Jews from settling there in 1546. At that point, the former synagogue was converted into a hospital (though the Hebrew inscription on the building's exterior was preserved). \n\nIn 1584 Jews were permitted to attend the town fairs, but it was not until Jews throughout the Austrian Empire were emancipated, and residence restrictions were subsequently lifted, that a Jewish community was able to be reestablished in Litomerice. Six Jewish families settled in Litomerice in 1851, and by 1863 there were 100 Jews living in the town. The community was officially constituted in 1875 and a synagogue was dedicated in 1883. \n\nThere were 616 Jews living in the town in 1921. The community of Litomerice became a center for other, smaller communities in the region, including the eventually infamous town of Terezin (German: Theresienstadt).   \n\nBetween the two World Wars, the newly constituted Republic of Czechoslovakia recognized the Jews as a national minority, prompting an increased interest in, and engagement with, Zionism. The Litomerice agricultural school included a training center whose goal was to prepare Jewish youth for eventual settlement in Mandate Palestine. The Zionist politician Emil Margulies lived in Litomerice. This sense of Jewish nationalism can be seen in the results of the 1930 census; the community numbered 425 people (2.3% of the total population), of whom 143 declared their nationality as Jewish. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nThe Munich Agreement of September, 1938 resulted in the dissolution of the Republic of Czechoslovakia and the annexation of the Sudeten Region, which included Litomerice, to Nazi Germany. Most of the Jews living in Litomerice subsequently fled to other regions, including Bohemia and Moravia; the few Jews who remained in the town were arrested and deported to concentration camps. Those Jews who fled to the region of Bohemia and Moravia would not remain safe for long. In March, 1939 Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the area's Jews. Beginning in 1941 Czech Jews were sent to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were deported to a number of concentration and death camps, where most perished. \n\nDuring World War II a branch of the Flossenburg concentration camp, along with a crematorium, were established in Litomerice. After the war, staff members who worked in Terezin were tried in Litomerice.   \n\nTHE COMMUNITY OF LOVOSICE  \n\nThere was also a Jewish community on the opposite bank of the Elbe River from Litomerice. According to oral tradition, the community was founded by the Jews who had been expelled from Litomerice in 1541, though the first documentary evidence attesting to the presence of Jews in the town dates to 1704. During18th century there were 17 Jewish homes in the city. The Jews of Lovosice worked in shipping, and developed the business of shipping products on the Elbe to Germany. They also dealt in chocolate production. The prominent Hoenigsberg family lived in the town for some time. In 1930 there were 201 people living in the community. The fate of the community during World War II, which was also located in the annexed Sudeten Region, was similar to that of the community of Litomerice.

Republic\n\nLostice is located 18 miles (29km) southeast of the city of Olomouc. Until 1918 Lostice and the surrounding region were part of the Austrian Empire. Between the two World Wars, and during the postwar era, until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe synagogue building underwent a major restoration in 2011. After another restoration in 2014, it was officially opened as an educational and cultural center. The center is administered by Respect and Tolerance, an organization dedicated to documenting, researching, and teaching about Jewish history and culture in northern Moravia. The center includes a permanent exhibition about local Jewish history, the Otto Wolf Library, which was opened in 2008, as well as a Holocaust memorial. The sanctuary's pews are from the synagogue of Olomouc, which was destroyed by the Nazis in 1939. \n\nThe Jewish cemetery has tombstones dating from the late 17th century through the 20th century, in addition to a new pre-burial house. The cemetery is owned by the Jewish community of Olomouc and can be freely accessed. \n\nOne of the Torah scrolls from Lostice that was sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague during World War II has been on permanent loan to Congregation Ohev Shalom in Wallingford, Pennsylvania, since 1980. Another Torah scroll from Lostice is on permanent loan to Congregation Hakafa in Glencoe, Illinois. In 2005 the rabbi and a number of congregants from Congregation Hakafa, took their Torah to Lostice, where they conducted the first services in the synagogue since the Nazi occupation.   \n\nHISTORY \n\nThe first records of Jews living in Lostice date to 1544. At that point, during the middle of the 16th century, there were 7 Jewish families lived in the town. Other records from 1571 mention a synagogue and a Jewish school; a cemetery had been consecrated in 1554. In 1581 the community purchased a piece of land, possibly in order to build a synagogue, and started keeping a register for the community. During this period the community was led by a Jewish judge and two jurors. \n\nDuring the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) many Jews left Lostice. As a result, by1656 only 10 of the 21 Jewish houses were occupied. However, the following year Jewish refugees began arriving from Austria and the Ukraine, and the community began to grow rapidly. By 1727 there were 80 Jewish families (328 people) living in 17 houses, all of which were located near the town's Catholic Church. That same year the Jews were moved to a ghetto, which was made up of Novosadi Street (later renamed Ztracena Street) and parts of two other adjoining streets west of the town square. The wooden synagogue, which had been built in 1651, was also moved to the ghetto.\n\nIn the beginning the ghetto contained 17 houses, though the number of houses eventually grew to 25. The ghetto functioned autonomously, and contained its own town hall. By the end of the 18th century 71 Jewish families were permitted to live in Lostice, all of whom were required to live in the ghetto. \n\nA number of communal institutions were established during the 18th century. In 1743 the local ruler ordered that a new Jewish cemetery be opened, though there is no evidence that any Jewish burials actually took place there. An elementary school was opened in 1782 in the community center. The teachers were Catholic; Jacob Rosenblum, one of the few Jewish teachers, only taught between 1791 and 1794. A turning point came in 1804 when Emanuel Goldschmied was hired; he would ultimately teach at the school until his death in 1839. After Goldschmied, a number of Jewish teachers began teaching at the school. \n\nIn 1791 there were 414 Jews (210 men and 204 women) living in Lostice. That year a major fire broke out, and 5 of the 22 Jewish houses were destroyed. Eventually, in 1805, a new synagogue was built to replace the old wooden synagogue. The community also established a women's society, as well as a society to aid the poor. A chevra kaddisha was formed in 1820.\n\nAmong the rabbis who served the community of Lostice was Rabbi Gershon b. Abraham Reik, who is mentioned in sources from 1708. Rabbi Dr. Asriel Guenzig was the community's last rabbi, and served from 1899 until 1918. Subsequently, the community had no rabbi of its own; when necessary it referred to Rabbi Professor Berthold Oppenheim, who served in the city of Olomouc.\n\nPerhaps the most famous rabbi to serve the community of Lostice was Rabbi Abraham Neuda (1812-1854). Rabbi Neuda attended yeshiva in Mikulov (German: Nikolsburg), and studied under Rabbi Nechemya Trebitsch, the chief rabbi of Moravia; secretly, however, Neuda also studied secular subjects with his fellow students. When the community of Lostice appointed Neuda to succeed his father as the community's rabbi without the approval of Rabbi Trebitsch, Rabbi Trebitsch was incensed, and refused to ordain Neuda; Rabbi Trebitsch was angered both by the threat to his authority, as well as the fact that Neuda had adopted certain practices of the German Reform Jewish movement, including giving sermons in German. A major controversy broke out and the provincial government was forced to become involved. In the end Rabbi Neuda was ordained, and the provincial government rescinded Rabbi Trebitsch's privilege to appoint rabbis. \n\nRabbi Neuda was married to Fanny Schmiedl, herself the daughter of a rabbi. In 1854 Schmiedl wrote the first prayer book that is known to have been written for women, by a woman. In addition to the more than 50 prayers relating to different aspects of a woman's life, Schmiedl's prayer book included information about the public and private events in the life of a Jewish woman. Schmidl's prayer book was called \"Hours of Devotion: Book of Prayer and edification for Jewish Wives and Young Women.\" Twelve years after its initial publication, the prayer book was translated into English and published in the United States. The book also became incredibly popular throughout Central Europe; more than 30 editions were published, the last of which was published in Basel, Switzerland, in 1968. Schmiedl also wrote stories about the domestic life of Jews in Bohemia and Moravia.        \n\nJews throughout the Austrian Empire were emancipated and granted full civil rights in 1848. Additionally, residence and economic restrictions were subsequently repealed, allowing Jews to live wherever they wanted, and enter into a variety of professional fields that had heretofore been closed to them. During the year of the emancipation, 483 Jews were living in Lostice (17% of the total population). With the removal of residence restrictions, however, many Jews throughout the region began migrating to larger towns and cities, seeking new economic and educational opportunities. By 1880 the community of Lostice had dwindled to 193 members, of whom only 87 lived in the town itself while the rest lived in neighboring villages. In 1900 there were 115 members left in the community. Also not helping matters was the fire that broke out in 1928, destroying most of the houses in the Jewish Quarter. \n\nAfter the emancipation of 1848, Jews were able to enter the academic professions. Until then, Jews throughout Moravia lived on lands belonging to the local rulers; in exchange for being allowed to live on the land, the Jews paid the rulers protection money and provided them with various services. Most Jews worked as merchants; there are records of Jewish merchants at the Leipzig fairs from 1697 to 1748. Others worked as craftsmen. At the end of the 18th century the Jews of Lostice owned a variety of shops, as well as a distillery of spirits. Two Jews worked as innkeepers, and one was known as a \"healer of wounds.\" \n\nA number of small villages in the area were affiliated with the Jewish community of Lostice. These included: \n\nMohelnice (German: Mueglitz). Mohelnice is located about 2 miles (3 km) northwest of Lostice. The Jews living in Mohelnice had a prayer house and, beginning in 1905, a separate section in the general cemetery;\n\nLotovel (German: Littau). Lotovel is located approximately 7 miles (11km) southeast of Lostice. During the 19th century the Jewish community of Lotovel opened a prayer house. The Jewish architect Heinrich Kulka was born in Litovel in 1900 and died in Oakland, New Zealand, in 1971.\n\nIn 1921 about 200 Jews belonged to the greater Lostice community. At that time the community's president was Sigfried Eckstein. The vast majority of the Jews in the area spoke German. \n\nThe Republic of Czechoslovakia, which was established at the end of World War I, recognized the Jews as a national minority with concurrent rights. This spurred the growth of Zionist activity in the area, particularly at Mohelnice, whose community members purchased membership and voting rights before the elections to the 15th Zionist Congress in 1927. \n\nDuring the 1930s there were still approximately 200 members in the community, 55 of whom lived in Lostice itself and (about 20% of the total population). By 1938, however, only 8 Jewish families remained in the area.\n\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nThe Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved following the Munich Agreement of September, 1938. Shortly thereafter, in March, 1939, Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the area's Jews. Beginning at the end of 1941 Czech Jews were deported to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to a number of concentration and death camps, where most perished. Before they were sent to Terezin, 700 documents, 225 books, and 195 ritual objects from the Jewish community of Lostice were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. In 1945 Jews who died during the death march from Auschwitz were buried at the cemetery of Mohelnice.\n\nPOSTWAR\n\nOnly one member from the community of Lostice survived the war. The synagogue building, which was first used as a warehouse, served as a municipal museum featuring exhibits on the life of the Jewish community between 1966 and 1980. In 1980 the building was turned into a music and art school. \n", "He": "\u05dc\u05d5\u05e9\u05d8\u05d9\u05e6\u05d4 LOSTICE\r\n\r\n(\u05d1\u05d2\u05e8\u05de\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea:

Laun\n\nA town in the Usti nad Labem Region, Czech Republic\n\nLouny is located on the Ohre River. Until 1918 it was part of the Austrian Empire. Between the two World Wars, and after World War II until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. \n\nThe reconstructed synagogue serves as a municipal archive. During a 2013 visit by a group from Old York Road Temple-Beth Am the town's mayor told the group that the space would eventually be renovated into a Jewish museum.  \n\nLouny's Jewish cemetery includes a pre-burial house with a tahara. The cemetery is owned by the Jewish community of Teplice, and can be accessed freely.  \n\nOne of the Torah scrolls from Louny which had been sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague during World War II has been in Old York Road Temple-Beth Am, in Abington, Pennsylvania, since 1973. In April, 2013 a group from the congregation traveled to Louny. \n\nOn June 23, 2013, the town held a large prayer ceremony celebrating 600 years of a Jewish presence in the region. A plaque was placed on the outside wall of what was once the synagogue building, with the inscription \"In memory of the citizens of our city who were victims of the Holocaust 1939-1945.\"\n\nHISTORY\n\nJews are first mentioned as living in Louny in 1254, when they were already living on a Jewish Street and had a synagogue and a cemetery. Most Jews worked as moneylenders and land dealers. At that point the community was affiliated with the congregation in Prague. \n\nBy 1505 there were 12 Jewish houses in Louny. In 1541, after one of the Jewish townspeople was accused of host desecration, the community was expelled. The Jews returned, however, and between the expulsion of various Jewish communities in Bohemia in 1541 and a major fire that broke out in the town in 1655 the community grew. Residence restrictions eventually allowed only one Jewish family to settle in the town, though at the end of the 18th century there were 43 Jews living in the town illegally. \n\nIn 1848 Jews throughout the Austrian Empire were emancipated and granted full civil rights; economic and residence restrictions were subsequently removed. At that point, Jews returned to live in Louny. A synagogue was soon built, and was consecrated in 1871. A new cemetery was established in 1874. The community also established a German-language Jewish school that enrolled approximately 40 students. Most of the community's Jews spoke German until 1893, when they adopted Czech as the official language. \n\nIn 1876 there were 44 Jewish taxpayers living in Louny. The Jewish population of Louny and the 18 surrounding villages in 1902 was 666. In 1930 there were 205 Jews living in Louny (1.8% of the total population), most of whom were assimilated.  \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nIn March, 1939 the region of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews living there. The Nazis closed the synagogue in October, 1941. By 1942 all of the Jews from the community had been sent to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto, before being deported to concentration and death camps. Before being sent to Terezin, ritual objects and equipment from the synagogue were sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague.\n", "He": "\u05dc\u05d5\u05d0\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9

Lobositz\n\nA small town in northern Bohemia, Usti nad Labem Region, Czech Republic\n\nLovosice is located 4 miles (6km) east of Terezin and 37 miles (60km) north of Prague. Until 1918 Lovosice and the region were part of the Austrian Empire. Between the two World Wars, and after World War II until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Between 1938 and 1945 Lovosice was one of the municipalities of the Sudeten Region.\n\nThe old cemetery was destroyed in 1956. The newer cemetery, which was consecrated in 1872, has a number of tombstones that have remained standing, in addition to unmarked mass graves. The cemetery also includes a pre-burial house, as well as a monument to the old cemetery, and a separate entrance for kohanim. The cemetery can be accessed freely. \n\nHISTORY\n\nIt is believed that the Jewish community of Lovosice was founded in 1541 by Jews who were expelled from town of Litomerice. \n\nIn 1702 there were ten houses that were registered in the town as owned by Jews; among them was a building that housed a beit midrash. Eventually there would be 17 houses in the Jewish part of the town; this included the synagogue building, which was erected in 1762, the community building, and the rabbi\u2019s home. A Jewish judge served as the administrative leader of the Jewish community. The synagogue was renovated for the first time in 1800 after being damaged in a fire; the interior would later be renovated again just before World War I, and the exterior wall would be renovated in 1924. \n\nThe rabbis who served the community included: Rabbi Heinrich Saar (1886-1905), Rabbi Salomon Levy (1905-1906), Rabbi Ignaz Levy (1906-1907), Rabbi Heinrich Brock (1907-1908), Dr. Salomon Frankfurter (1908-1912), Dr. Emil Friedmann (1912- 1916), and Dr. Mortiz Mueller (1917-1921). In 1921 Rabbi Ignaz Levy returned to serve the community. \n\nThe community's leaders included: Michael Kaill, who was the head of the Jewish community in 1791, Jacob Glaassner, Hermann Schiller, Max Gans-Schiller, Friedrich Gratum, Dr. Karl Glaassner, Wilhelm Bergwein, Max Wilhelm Schiller, Dr. Marcus Lowit (1914-1930), and Ernest Schwartz. The most prominent Jewish family in Lovosice was the Wohl family, though some members of the family converted to Christianity. \n\nThe old cemetery was dedicated in 1714 and was also used by the Jewish communities of Litomerice and Terezin. Another cemetery was dedicated around 1872. The latter cemetery had a chapel (zidduk hadin pavilion) and a special entrance for kohanim.\n\nAmong the community institutions were a women\u2019s society, which was founded in 1891, and a chevra kaddisha, whose regulations were approved in 1914. The town did not have a Jewish school, and Jewish children attended the local schools. Most of the Jews living in the town spoke German. \n\nIn the beginning, Jews worked as tobacco merchants, butchers, and glaziers. Meanwhile, the many Jews who lived in neighboring villages worked as grain exporters, mostly to Germany, via the Labe (German: Elbe) River. Jews also founded a tannery and were involved in establishing the chocolate and sweets industry. Edward Klein was the manager of a factory for fruit preserves. Later, manufacturing of men\u2019s clothing was one of the main sources of income for the local Jews. Dr. Ignaz Freund worked as the town doctor during the 19th century. \n\nDuring World War I Jews from Lovosice enlisted in the Austrian Army and five fell in battle. The Republic of Czechoslovakia, which was established after the war, recognized the Jews as a national minority, with concurrent rights. This prompted an interest in Zionism, which became active in Lovosice. \n\nIn 1921 there were 270 Jews living in Lovosice. In 1933 the Jewish population was 320, including 70 who lived in the surrounding neighborhoods.\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nThe Munich Agreement of September, 1938, resulted in the dissolution of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, and the annexation of the Sudeten Region, which included Lovosice, to Nazi Germany. At this point, the vast majority of Jews living in Lovosice left the town, many for areas in Bohemia and Moravia. The Nazis destroyed the synagogue in Lovosice. The region of Bohemia and Moravia ultimately became a protectorate of Nazi Germany in March, 1939, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the area's Jews. Beginning in 1941 Czech Jews were sent to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were deported to concentration and death camps, where most were killed. \n\nPOSTWAR \n\nIn 1946 a public funeral was held in Lovosice for the Czech Jews who were killed during the last days of the Nazi occupation on roads leading to the concentration camp in Terezin. \n\nThe Jewish Quarter was eventually demolished by the authorities. The old cemetery was demolished in 1956 and its zidduk hadin pavilion was given to the general cemetery.", "He": "\u05dc\u05d5\u05d1\u05d5\u05e1\u05d9\u05e6\u05d4

Lazne\n\nGerman: Marienbad\n\nA spa town, Karlovy Vary Region, Czech Republic\n\nA grassy lot with a memorial stone is all that remains of Marienbad's synagogue, which was destroyed on November 10, 1938 (Kristallnacht). \n\nThe bust in honor of Professor Samuel Basch was stolen in 2013, though the pedestal has remained in its original location. \n\nMost of the cemetery's tombstones were uprooted and destroyed by the Nazis. After World War II tombstones were taken from the cemeteries of Tachov and Kynzvart and moved to Marianske Lazne. \n\nHISTORY\n\nJews began to settle in Marienbad in 1820; until that point, Jews only went to Marienbad during the health cure season. Both the town itself, as well as the Jewish community, grew during the 19th century, with the Jewish community drawing new arrivals from Drmouly (German: Duerrmaul) and Lazne Kunzvart (Koenigswart). \n\nA number of notable figures from Prague prompted the building of a Jewish hospice. The hospice, which was built in 1861, included a prayer room and was built with the help of donations from Jewish visitors to Marienbad. The Jewish hospice was led by the balneologist Heinrich Enoch Kisch, who lived in Marienbad and contributed to its development; a street was eventually named for him. The professor and balneologist Samuel Basch was also instrumental in the town's development; a bust in his honored would be unveiled in 1930, removed by the Nazis, and re-erected in 1987. \n\nA congregation was officially organized in 1875, the same year the Jewish cemetery was consecrated, and a synagogue was dedicated in 1884. At that point Marienbad had become very popular among Jews living in the Russian Empire, however notable visitors to the town also included the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, and the writer Franz Kafka. Sholom Aleichem's 1911 novel Marienbad describes the Jewish visitors to the town and the Jewish spa culture there. \n \nThough Jews throughout the Austrian Empire, including Marienbad, had been emancipated and granted full civil rights in 1848, a municipal election statute, which was ultimately in force until 1918, barred Jews from being elected to the municipal council. Nonetheless, the Jews of Marienbad were involved in Jewish communal politics; the most striking example of this is when Agudas Yisroel's major assembly (Kenesset HaGedolah) was held in the town.  \nIn 1930 there were 405 Jews living in Marienbad (3.3% of the total population). \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nDuring the Sudeten Crisis of 1938, after which the Sudeten Region, which included Marienbad, was annexed to Nazi Germany, most of the community left the town. Those who remained were ultimately arrested by the Nazis. The synagogue was burned down, and the site was turned into a park.\n\nPOSTWAR\n\nA Jewish community was re-founded in 1945, mostly by army veterans from Subcarpathian Ruthenia. By 1949 there were 196 Jews living in the community. Additionally, for a time the town hosted a yeshiva for Holocaust survivors. \n\nIn 1970 the town's retirement home, which included a prayer room and a kosher restaurant, had over 100 residents from all over the country; the home and prayer room were closed in 1972.  \n\n", "He": "\u05de\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05e0\u05e1\u05e7\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d6\u05e0\u05d4 MARIANSKE

in the region of South Moravia, Czech Republic. The largest and most important Jewish community in Moravia until the mid-19th century. \n\nMikulov is located near the Austrian border. It is 28 miles (45km) south of Brno, and 44 miles (71km) northeast of Vienna. In the beginning, Mikulov was part of Greater Moravia. From 1526 until 1918 it was part of the Austrian Empire. During the interwar period, and after World War II until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Between 1938 and 1945 Mikulov was one of the municipalities in the Sudeten Region. \n\nApproximately 45 houses that stood in the Jewish Quarter have survived, each of which has been declared a cultural monument. The preserved buildings include what was once the Old Synagogue (Altschul), two cheders, a Jewish nursing home that was established in the middle of the 18th century, remnants of the Ashkenazi Synagogue, and a Jewish school for the deaf.  \n\nThe exterior of the Old Synagogue, which dates to the mid-16th century (the original building, which was built in 1450, was refurbished after a fire), has been preserved. Since the 1990s it has been accessible to the public, and has included an exhibit about the history of the Jewish community of Mikulov. \n\nA medieval mikvah (Jewish ritual bath) has been preserved and can be found on what was once known as Bath Square. The Mikulov Municipal Authority has worked with the Association of Friends of Jewish Culture in Mikulov to repair and refurbish parts of the mikvah. The mikvah is open to the public. \n\nThe Jewish cemetery has been well-preserved and contains approximately 4,000 tombstones, the oldest of which dates to 1605. A ceremonial hall is also located inside the cemetery; once used as a storehouse, it was renovated between 2000 and 2006 by the Jewish community of Brno and is used as an exhibition space devoted to the history of the cemetery and Jewish funeral rites. In 2009 a plaque was affixed to the wall of the building in honor of Rabbi Yehudah Leib ben Betzalel (the Maharal of Prague). A number of prominent rabbis are buried in Mikulov, including Rabbi Shmelke Horowitz and Mordecai Beneth, and their graves are popular sites for pilgrims. The cemetery is open to the public and also offers guided tours. \n\nHISTORY  \n\nThe first written evidence of Jews in Mikulov dates to 1369, However, it is believed that an actual Jewish community was established only after 1420, when Jews were expelled from Vienna and Lower Austria. Another expulsion in 1454, this time from Brno and Znojmo, brought more Jews to Mikulov.   \n\nIn 1575 the Dietrichstein family was placed in charge of Mikulov. They were relatively tolerant towards their Jewish citizens; in 1591 they granted the community autonomy, to be led by a Jewish representative (a \"Judge of the Jews\"). The Dietrichsteins also decided that the Jews would be under their jurisdiction, instead of the municipality's, and allowed them to pay their taxes in money instead of in additional manual labor. Each new lord approved this charter, with occasional modifications, until 1780. Under these conditions the Jewish community of Mikulov began to flourish, and in 1606 there were 1,586 Jews living in the town.  \n\nThe Jews of Mikulov were still subject to anti-Semitism, in spite of their relative privilege. An oral tradition has it that in June 1625 Emperor Ferdinand II visited Mikulov. While passing through the Jewish Quarter a nobleman traveling with him was hit with a stone and died. The emperor threatened that if the person who threw the stone failed to come forward within 3 days, he would expel all the Jews from the town. When the 3 days passed and no one confessed, Rabbi Eliakum sacrificed himself and falsely confessed; as punishment he was blinded. Whether this story is historically true or not, it does indicate a sense of insecurity on the part of Mikulov's Jews regarding whether they would always be protected by the reigning noblemen. \n\nBetween 1645 and 1646 the plague tore through Mikulov, leaving 964 Jews dead. Soon after, however, the Jewish population rose significantly following the Chmielnicki massacres (1648-1649), which saw a number of refugees seeking a safe haven in the town. As a result, by 1657 there were 146 Jewish families were living in Mikulov. They were joined shortly thereafter by refugees from the second Jewish expulsion from Vienna in 1670. Still later, after the Habsburgs conquered Belgrade in 1688, the Jews from Belgrade who had been ransomed were settled in Mikulov. In spite of laws that limited the number of Jewish families permitted to live in Mikulov, by the reign of Empress Maria Theresa (1740-1780) there were 620 Jewish families living in Mikulov, approximately half of the town's total population.\n\nThe Jews of Mikulov lived in a separate Jewish Quarter. As a result of the cramped, overcrowded conditions in the Jewish Quarter, a number of fires broke out over the years. In the wake of fires in 1561 and 1584, it became forbidden to build wooden buildings. A fire in 1719 destroyed much of the Jewish Quarter, including the Old Synagogue, which had been built around 1450, and the community archive. Though there was some initial opposition to reconstructing the synagogue on the part of the local lord, the court Jew Samson Wertheimer, who was then in Vienna, prevailed upon him to allow for the synagogue's reconstruction.  \n\nIn 1789, when 57 Jewish communities in the region were officially recognized by the authorities, there were 600 Jewish families living in Mikulov. In 1793 there were 3,000 Jews living in the town. In 1829 there were 3,237 Jews living in Mikulov.\n\nBefore the construction of the railroad, Mikulov was located on a major trade route between Vienna and Brno, a fact that contributed greatly to its success and the success of the local Jews. Most of the town's Jews were traveling peddlers, or traded in wines (particularly a plum wine that was unique to Mikulov), textiles, candles, and animal hides, while others worked as tailors, butchers, and cobblers. \n\nMoravia was the seat of the chief rabbinate of Moravia beginning in the mid-16th century. As a result, a number of prominent rabbis came to serve the town's Jewish community. Yehudah Leib ben Betzalel (the Maharal of Prague) was probably the community's first rabbi (1553-1573). Other rabbis included Moshe ben Aharon Lvov (Lemberger), Rabbi Gershon Politz (1758-1772), the kabbalah and Jewish mysticism scholar Rabbi Shmelke Horowitz (1772-1778), Rabbi Gershon Hayes (1778-1789), Rabbi Mordecai Beneth (1789-1842), Rabbi Nehemyah Trebitsch (1831-1842), and Samson Raphael Hirsch (1847-1851). \n\nMikulov was home to one of the most prominent yeshivas in Moravia, which flourished under the leadership of Rabbi Beneth. Students from all over Bohemia, Poland, and Hungary came to study in Mikulov. The yeshiva would produce Torah scholars until it closed in 1856. In addition to the yeshiva, Mikulov was home to 12 synagogues, each of which was named either according to its congregation's occupation (ex. Cobblers), the names of its philanthropists (ex. Abeles), the congregation's origins (ex. Wiener), the religious customs (ex. Ashkenazic), or the age of the synagogue (Old, New). There was also a Hebrew printing press, which functioned between 1762 and 1779, and at the turn of the 18th century. A German Jewish elementary school was established in 1782, a German Jewish high school and vocational school were opened in 1839, and in 1844 Hirsch Kolisch opened a school in Mikulov for the Jewish deaf. The community also had its own chevra kaddisha, which had been established 1653, a Jewish hospital that was opened in1680, a women\u2019s society, and the \"Nachstenliebe\" men's society. \n\nIn 1836 the gates that separated the Jewish Quarter from the rest of the town were removed. This was progress for the town's Jews. However, the town began to decline shortly thereafter, prompted by the 1838 decision to bypass the town on the Vienna-Brno railroad. Shortly thereafter, in 1848, Jews throughout the Austrian Empire were emancipated, and granted full civil rights. Residence and economic restrictions were also subsequently removed. As a result of this newfound freedom of movement, Jews throughout the region began moving to larger cities, seeking more economic and educational opportunities. Mikulov was no exception to this trend, and many Jews from the town began moving to Brno and to Vienna. From a population peak in 1857 of 3,680, the population dropped to 1,500 by 1869. Subsequently the Jewish population of Mikulov kept falling: to 1,213 in 1880, to 900 in 1900. Indeed, by 1900 the town whose population had once been mostly Jewish, had become 60% Christian. There were 573 living in Mikulov in 1921, and 437 in 1930 (6.5% of the town's total population). Additionally, by 1868 only 5 of Mikulov's original 12 synagogues had remained active; by the twentieth century only two synagogues continued to function.      \n\nIn 1851, after Rabbi Hirsch moved to Frankfurt/Main, the seat of the chief rabbinate of Moravia was moved to Brno. Local rabbis who continued to serve the community in Mikulov included Rabbi Hirsch Teltscher, Rabbi Isaac Wienberger, Rabbi Solomon Katasch, Rabbi Dr. Meir Feuchtwanger (1861-1888), Rabbi Dr. David Feuchtwanger (1892-1903), Rabbi Dr. Moritz Levin (1903-1918), and Rabbi Dr. Alfred Willman (1919-1938).\n\nAt the start of World War I a refugee camp was built approximately 3 miles (5km) from Mikulov for those fleeing from Galicia and Bukovina, including approximately 8,000 Jews. The Jewish community of Mikulov established a school and a yeshiva for the children of these refugees. Most returned to their towns of origin after the war. Many Jews from Mikulov enlisted in the army during World War I, 25 of whom fell in battle and were buried in the Jewish cemetery.\n\nThe Republic of Czechoslovakia, which was established in 1918 in the wake of World War I, recognized the Jews as a national minority with concurrent rights, prompting many to become active in the Zionist movement. In 1920 a Zionist society was organized in Mikulov. A Jewish sport club, which had been founded in 1910, became a local branch of the Maccabi sports league during the 1920s; Maccabi games were held at Mikulov in 1933. Twenty-eight Jews from Mikulov took part in the elections to the 20th Zionist Congress in 1937.\n\nIn 1936 the Jewish Museum for Moravia and Silesia was established in Mikulov. It contained old parchment manuscripts, curtains of the Holy Ark, ritual objects, a 1653 register from the chevra kaddisha, as well as other other documents and paintings. The collection was moved to Brno in 1938, and then to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague in 1942. \n\nNotable figures from Mikulov include the legal scholar Joseph von Sonnenfels (1732-1817, though he converted to Christianity as a child), the historian Abraham Trebitsch (1760-1840), the author Eduard Kulke (1831-1897), who wrote stories about Moravian Jewry, the author and journalist Heinrich Landesmann (known as Hieronymus Lorm, 1821-1902), and the Berlin actor Max Pohl (1855-1935). The Jewish surname Naach/Nash is derived from an abbreviation of the town's name.  \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of September, 1938, the Republic of Czechoslovakia was dissolved and the Sudeten Region, which included Mikulov, was annexed to Nazi Germany. At that point nearly all of Mikulov's Jews fled the town. Those who remained were arrested and transported in 1941 and 1942, first to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto, and then to concentration and death camps where most perished. Along with the collection from the Jewish museum, 1,580 documents, 210 books, and 1,233 ritual objects from the Jewish community of Mikulov were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. \n\nDuring the war, Jews worked as part of a forced labor battalion at the Mikulov brickworks; 21 Hungarian Jews from the battalion were killed on April 15, 1945 and buried in a mass grave in the Jewish cemetery.  \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nIn 1948 there were 36 Jews living in Mikulov, most of whom were survivors from the original community. Communal life was not reestablished and by the 1990s there were no Jews left in Mikoluv. Most of the Jewish Quarter was demolished, but the Old Synagogue was used for concerts and museum exhibitions; since 1995 there has been an exhibition about the Jewish community of Mikulov. The community's regulations from the 18th century are kept in the National Library in Jerusalem.\n\n", "He": "\u05de\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5\u05dc\u05d5\u05d1

located on the left bank of the Jizera River, 31 miles (50km) northeast of Prague. Until 1918 Mlada Boleslav and the surrounding region were part of the Austrian Empire. During the interwar period, and between the end of World War II and 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. \n\nWith the communities of Kolin, Roudnice, and Nachod, Mlada Boleslav was one of the four major Jewish communities of Bohemia known by the Hebrew acronym KRBN. Mlada Boleslav also became known as the \"Jerusalem of the Jizera River,\" attesting to its importance. \n\nThe Jewish cemetery is owned by the Jewish community of Prague, which funds its continued maintenance. The cemetery has managed to survive relatively intact, and contains tombstones from the 17th century through the 20th century, as well as a pre-burial house. The cemetery can be accessed with permission. \n\nHISTORY\n\nThe Jewish community of Mlada Boleslav is first mentioned in 1471, and is noted in a Hebrew document from 1556. Eleven families lived in the town in 1570, and by 1579 the community was also home to a synagogue. The cemetery was consecrated shortly thereafter, in 1584, and the New School was built at the end of the century. \n\nMlada Boleslav was owned by various noble Czech families until 1594. A Jewish resident of the town, David Fleckeles, contributed a large sum of money (1,000 florins) in order to purchase the city's independence.  \n\nAt the beginning of the 17th century Mlada Boleslav's Jewish Quarter contained 31 houses, a town hall, a hospital, and a mikvah (ritual bath). There were 120 Jewish adults living in Mlada Boleslav in 1615. The Jewish population rose to 775 in 1687, due mainly to an influx of Jews from Poland fleeing the Khmelnytsky Massacres of 1648-1649, and Jews who had been expelled from Vienna in 1670. \n\nAfter a fire in the late 17th century destroyed part of the Jewish Quarter, as well as the synagogue. The community rebuilt the synagogue in 1697, and modeled it after the Maisel synagogue in Prague. Another fire, this time in 1854, prompted the composition and publication of a special selichah (penitential prayer). \n\nIn 1710 a shopkeeper named David Brandeis was imprisoned after being accused of poisoning a local Christian printer with plum jam. After his release he composed a megillah, titled \"Shir HaMa'a lot Le-David\" (\"A Song of Ascent of David).This megillah was read on the tenth of the Jewish month of Adar, the day of Brandeis' exoneration and release from prison, and the day was celebrated as a local Purim festival, known as the Povidl (Plum Jam) Purim.\n\nIn 1848 Jews throughout the Austrian Empire were emancipated. This gave Jews in Mlada Boleslav the opportunity to become active in local politics; a number took part in the city's administration, while others were elected to serve as members of the municipality. \n\nThe Bohemian-Jewish writer Leopold Kompert (1822-1886), who wrote during the 19th century about Jewish life in Bohemia, wrote about Mlada Boleslav in Die Kinder des Randars (\"The Randar Children\"). He describes Mlada Boleslav as a kind of a Bohemian Chelm; many tales were told of \"bumsler shtiklekh\" (\"pranks\") that took place in the town. There was, however, a darker side to life in Mlada Boleslav; in 1897 anti-Jewish riots broke out in the city, a result of national tensions between Czechs and Germans when Jews were often seen as proponents of German culture. \n\nThe Jewish population numbered 794 in 1834. It rose to 865 (9.1% of the total population) in 1880, at which point the population began to drop. There were 402 Jews living in Mlada Boleslav (2.8% of the total) in 1910, the Jewish population was 419 in 1921; and 264 (1.3%) in 1930.\n\nRabbi Shmuel ben Yosef of Lublin, the author of the Lekhem Rav, was the community's first rabbi and served during the early 17th century. Other rabbis who served in Mlada Boleslav included Moses Isaac Spira, who served circa 1702 and later became the chief rabbi of Bohemia (he was also the father in law of Rabbi Yonatan Eybeshutz), Ezekiel Glogau-Schlesinger, the author of the Mar'eh Yekhezkel, who served until 1821, Isaac Yom Tov Spitz (1824-1842), the son-in-law of Elazar Fleckeles, and Moritz Grunwald (1886-1893), who later became the chief rabbi of Bulgaria.  \n\nA local Jewish museum was founded in 1922 by Hermann Pollak, who taught in the local Jewish school. During World War II it was shut down and its collection (which included historical archives that dated to the 16th century) was transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague, where they remain. \n\nJust before World War II there were 183 Jews living in the city. \n\nAmong the notable Jews from Mlada Boleslav was the Czech poet, and first Jew to publish in the Czech language, Sigfried Kapper (1821-1879). His house was eventually marked by a memorial tablet. Benjamin Issac (d. 1750), a \"Jew merchant of extensive charity,\" was from Mlada Boleslav; after he moved to London he established a foundation in his name in Mlada Boleslav. The rabbi and Talmudist Meir Fischels (1703-c.1770), who served as the head of the yeshiva and beit din in Prague for forty years, was also from Mlada Boleslav.\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\nIn March, 1939 the region of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews living there. By 1938 ritual objects had already been transferred from the synagogue to the Central Museum in Prague; during the war the synagogue building was used as a warehouse. In January1942 the Jews from Mlada Boleslav and the surrounding districts, a total of 1,041 people, were concentrated in the old castle. From there they were deported to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto before being sent to a number of concentration and death camps. Of the 1,041 people who had been deported to Terezin, only 40 were still alive in November, 1944. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nAfter World War II a small congregation was reestablished, administered by the Jewish community of Prague. This newly reestablished community would prove to be short-lived; it ceased functioning during the 1950s. The synagogue, which had been rebuilt in 1697, was demolished in 1962.

The cemetery is freely accessible.    \n\nHISTORY\n\nThe Jewish community of Moravske Budejovice was among those mentioned as suffering from the riots and massacres that took place following host desecration libel of Pulkau, a town in Austria, in 1338. One Jewish man, by the name of Jacob, is mentioned in the town in 1363; he is mentioned again in1386 as a member of an association that sought to buy and sell a village. Later, beginning in 1528, transactions between Jews and non-Jews are frequently mentioned in town records, mostly involving loans and the sale of houses, horses, and grain. Jews also worked as moneylenders. They were not, however, permitted to sell alcohol or to brew beer. \n\nIn 1562 there were 47 Jews in the community of Moravske Budejovice. They were expelled in 1564. Though they were not officially allowed to settle in the town until the middle of the 19th century, a tobacco agent arrived to work and settle in the town in 1774, a Jewish man leased a distillery in the town in 1808, and Jews continued to attend local fairs; between 1794 and 1842 approximately 120 Jewish merchants attended the fairs. \n\nThere were 19 Jews living in Moravske Budejovice in 1848, the year when Jews throughout the Austrian Empire were emancipated. As a result of the subsequent removal of residence and economic restrictions, the Jewish population of Moravske Budejovice began to rise. The Jewish population was 58 in 1869, and rose to 127 in 1890 before dropping to 97 in 1900. A congregation was founded in 1867 and officially recognized in 1890. A cemetery was consecrated in 1908, and a synagogue in 1910. \n\nThe community ceased functioning independently in 1926 and began to be administered by the Jewish community of Safov (Schaffa). In 1930 the community numbered 77 (1.8% of the total population).\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST \n\nIn 1942 the Jews who remained in the town were deported to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps, where most were killed.  Ritual objects and equipment from the synagogue were sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nJewish life was not renewed in Moravske Budejovice after the war. The synagogue was used as a warehouse, and torn down in 1977.

"Moravsky Krumlov\n\nGerman: Maehrisch-Kromau, Kromau\n\nA town in the South Moravian Region, Czech Republic\n\nMoravsky Krumlov is located 18 miles (29km) southwest of Brno. Until 1918 it was part of the Austrian Empire. During the interwar period, and between the end of World War II and 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. \n\nThe Jewish cemetery contains approximately 500 tombstones. It is open to the public. \n\nHISTORY\n\nJews were mentioned as living in the town in 1402. A synagogue was built in 1547 and the cemetery was consecrated sometime during the 16th century. The familiants law, which governed the number of Jewish families permitted to live in any particular town, limited the number of Jewish families in Moravsky Krumlov to 49. By 1800 there were 43 houses in the town that were owned by Jews, a particularly high number for Moravia. \n\nIn 1848 Jews throughout the Austrian Empire were emancipated, and residence restrictions were subsequently removed. As a result, many Jews throughout the region began moving to larger towns and cities, seeking greater economic and educational opportunities. Consequently, following the emancipation, the Jewish population of Moravsky Krumlov decreased steadily, from 356 in 1830 to 226 in 1869. In 1880 the town's Jewish population was 140, and in 1900 it was. By 1930 only 34 Jews (0.9% of the total population) remained in the town. \n\nAfter 1848 the Jewish community became a politische gemeinde (an independent political entity), though it relinquished this privilege in 1869. Beginning in 1915 the community was led by Heinrich Flesch, who served as the rabbi of nearby Dolni Kounice. The few Jews that remained in the town during World War II were deported by the Nazis, first to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto, and then to concentration and death camps.

During the interwar period, and between the end of World War II until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Between 1938 and 1945 it was one of the municipalities in the Sudeten Region. \n\nThe first evidence of Jews living in Most dates to 1393, with a promissory note given to Jewish moneylenders; it is thought, however, that Jews had been living in the city since 1356 when Emperor Karl IV of the House of Luxemburg (1345-1378) allowed both free towns and the rulers of the royal towns of Bohemia to allow Jews to settle within their jurisdictions. The Jews of Most then lived on a \"Jewish Street,\" which was located near the monastery. The street was later renamed the Sterngasse. They generally worked as moneylenders, and provided other services to the local ruler.\n\nIn 1456 the Jews were expelled from Most and were forbidden to live within a mile of the city limits. Some of those who were expelled settled in distant villages or on noble estates, while others left for Rudolice, near the town of Chomutov. During the 18th century residence restrictions were eased somewhat, and Jews were permitted to settle in the nearby towns of Lisnice, Horany, (German: Hareth), Korozluki, and Kopitz. Each of these towns became home to a small Jewish community, and beginning in 1821 a community register was kept of communities throughout the region. \n\nIn 1839, although Jews were still subject to residence restrictions and forbidden from living in Most, Leopold Mandel was allowed to lease spirit distillery and given the right to purchase a home in Most. Nine years later, in 1848, Jews throughout the Austrian Empire were emancipated and economic and residence restrictions were subsequently removed. By 1861 there were 15 Jews living in Most, though they still held religious services in the synagogue of Horany. Gradually, however, the small communities surrounding Most were dissolved, and their Torah scrolls and ritual objects were transferred to Most (for instance, the synagogue in Horany was converted into a private home in 1870; during the 1930s it was used as a storage facility for grain). A synagogue was dedicated in Most in 1872.  \n\nTowards the end of the 19th century Most became one of the most important communities in Bohemia. Most Jews living in the city spoke German, though some spoke Czech, and all understood both languages. Jewish children attended the general schools and were taught religious subjects by the cantors Jacob Lam and Joseph Miller; Rabbi Dr. Michael Halberstam taught religious subjects in the high school. Although most of the Jews living in the city were not religious, there were daily services held at the synagogue in the mornings and evenings; on holidays Jewish children did not go to school and Jewish shops were closed. The community supported the local German theater, the municipal museum, the fire brigade, and various health, charity, and sports organizations.\n\nThe Jews who settled in Most during middle of the 19th century generally worked as grain and cattle merchants while others worked as craftsmen; the first Jewish physician settled in Most in 1864. After World War I Most entered a period of economic prosperity and many Jewish professionals came to live in Most, including physicians, dentists, lawyers, and engineers. Most of the Jews living in Most were middle or upper class, and were able to support needy Jews in other areas. \n\nDr. Alexander Kisch served as the community's first rabbi, and held the position between 1874 and 1877. He was followed by Dr. Samuel Bloch (1877-1879), who would eventually publish the weekly \"Ostereichische Wochenschrift, Dr. Jacob Tauber, who was decorated by Emperor Franz Joseph, Rabbi Dr. Gothard Deutsch who was appointed in 1881 as a history professor at Hebrew Union College in Cincinatti, Ohio, and Rabbi Dr. Adolf Biach, the co-writer of a textbook on history and Jewish literature that became a standard textbook in high schools throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The community's leaders included the physician Dr. Moritz Glaser, the jurist Dr. Joseph Spitz, who led the community for approximately 30 years, Siegmund Woditschka, and Robert Heller. The community also employed a cantor, gabbais, and cemetery workers.\n\nDuring World War I (1914-1918) a large prisoner of war camp was established near Most. There were Jews among the Russian prisoners interned in the camp, and the community of Most worked to assist them. In 1917 a plague broke out in the camp; the Jewish prisoners who died were buried in the Jewish cemetery and a statue was erected in their memory. Additionally, in 1926 a plaque was placed in the synagogue in memory of the Jewish soldiers from Most who were killed in action during World War I. \n\nAfter the establishment of the Republic of Czechoslovakia in 1918 the German residents in the regions of Bohemia and Moravia rebelled against the new government and some Jews from Most fought on the German side. The rebellion was ultimately forcibly suppressed by the Czechs, and many of the Jews who took part in it were caught and imprisoned. They were released only when President Thomas Masaryk declared a general amnesty.\n\nJews in Most and throughout Bohemia and Moravia became involved in public life after the emancipation of 1848. However, their political involvement intensified after World War I, when the Republic of Czechoslovakia recognized the Jews as a national minority with concurrent rights. In 1919 a delegate from the Jewish national party was elected to the local council. Additionally, Zionism became popular. Though Zionist activity took place in the community at the beginning of the 20th century, it increased substantially during the interwar period. Local branches of the youth organizations Blau-Weiss, Tekhelet Lavan, and Maccabi were established; the first Maccabi games in Czechoslovakia were played in Most in the winter of 1923. Some of those who joined Tekhelet Lavan left for Mandate Palestine in 1929 and were among the founders of Kibbutz Sarid. Before the elections to the 15th Zionist Congress in 1927, Jews from Most purchased membership and voting rights; later, during the 1937 elections to the 20th Zionist Congress in Zurich a representative from Most was elected as a delegate, and 110 community members took part in the elections. Otto Kahn, a resident of Most, was later elected to the council of regional representatives. In 1935 training groups under the auspices of HeHalutz and WIZO were active, and sought to prepare young Jews to emigrate to Palestine. Additionally, Dr. Oskar Neuman, one of the leading Zionists of Slovakia, was born in Most.\n\nThe census of 1921 found 1,250 Jews living in the community of Most; 737 lived in the city itself, while the rest lived in nearby settlements. During the 1930s the Jewish community of Most, which included Jews from nearby villages, consisted of 315 families (approximately 1,000 people. A two-story community house was built in 1930 in the synagogue's courtyard. It included a large prayer house for the winter months, a meeting hall, a library, and apartments for some of the community's employees.\n\nFollowing the sweeping victory of the Sudeten German party in the general elections of 1936-1937, many Czechs voted for the Jewish party; the Jewish party received approximately 600 votes, even though only 400 Jews were eligible to vote. Dr. A. Taussig, the representative of the Jewish party representative, was elected to the council of Most and Leon Glaser was elected as a deputy member.\n\nIn 1930, 662 Jews were living in Most, out of a total population of 33,000.\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nOn the night of September 24, 1938, about a week before the Munich Agreement would be signed, which would dissolve the Republic of Czechoslovakia and annex the Sudeten Region to Germany, panic broke out among the Jews of Most. About 80% of them left the town that night, while the rest left immediately before the annexation. Nearly all of them left for other areas in Bohemia and Moravia. The synagogue was set on fire by local Nazis on Kristallnacht (November 10,1938) and destroyed completely. \n\nSome Jews from Most succeeded in fleeing the country before World War II broke out in September, 1939. Some left for Palestine, others for England, the United States, Canada, as well as other countries. Some of those who left Most fought against the Nazis in the armies of their adopted countries, as well as in the Czech military. Those who fled to other areas in Bohemia and Moravia, however, were less lucky. Bohemia and Moravia were occupied by the Nazis on March 15, 1939 and became a protectorate of Nazi Germany; this ushered in a period of discrimination and violence against the area's Jews. Beginning in 1941 Jews throughout the Czech lands were sent to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were deported to concentration and death camps, where most perished. Approximately 80% of the Jews from Most were killed during the war. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nAfter the war some surviving Jews from Most, as well as other Jewish families from Carpatho-Russia, returned to the city and reestablished a Jewish community, led by Emil Krulig. In 1948 there were 162 Jews living in Most. However, over time many of Most's Jews left for other countries, and the community became affiliated with Usti nad Labem.\n\nBetween 1985 and 1989 Most was completely demolished and rebuilt on the slope of the mountain, following a government decision to take advantage of the coal deposits under the old town. The Jewish cemetery, which was located on the slope of one of the hills, remained untouched and was looked after by a local resident. The last Jewish burial took place in the Most cemetery in 1977; afterwards any Jewish burials took place in the regional cemetery of Usti nad Labem. \n\nIn 1990 two Jewish couples and an old Jewish woman were living in Most.", "He": "\u05de\u05d5\u05e1\u05d8 MOST\n\n(\u05d1\u05d2\u05e8\u05de\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea BRUX)\n\n\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d1\u05e6\u05e4\u05d5\u05df-\u05de\u05e2\u05e8\u05d1

located in the valley of the Metuje River, on the Polish border. Until 1918 it was part of the Austrian Empire. During the interwar period, and between the end of World War II and 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. \n\nOne of the Torah scrolls that was sent from Nachod to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague during World War II is on permanent loan to the Arden Heights Boulevard Jewish Center: Congregation Etz Chaim in Staten Island, New York. \n\nHISTORY\n\nThe Jewish community of Nachod was one of the four oldest in Bohemia, and among the most important. The first written evidence of a Jewish community dates to the city records of 1455 and the Jewish Street dates to the end of the 15th century. The Jews were expelled from Nachod in 1542; to add insult to injury, many were robbed as they made their way to Poland. They returned, however, in 1544. A Jewish school is mentioned in documents from 1547; the cemetery was consecrated shortly thereafter, in 1550, and a mikveh was built in 1592. By 1570 there were 11 families recorded as living in the town. \n\nIn 1663, the Jews were accused of having caused a fire that destroyed the Jewish Quarter, along with a large part of the town. One member of the community was executed while the rest were attacked. Many fled Nachod and founded a community in Ceska Skalice; this community was eventually expelled in 1705. The Jewish community of Nachod was once again reestablished shortly after this second expulsion, and by 1724 it had 60 Jewish families. The synagogue was rebuilt in 1777. Jews became active in making Nachod a center of the textile industry, the culmination of which was in 1848 when Isaac Mautner founded the famous Mautner Textile Company. \n\nJews throughout the Austrian Empire were emancipated in 1848 and granted full civil rights and residence restrictions were subsequently removed. Emancipation, however, could not guarantee the Jews' safety. In 1899 the Jews of Nachod, along with their coreligionists throughout the region, were the victims of anti-Semitic riots spurred by the Hilsner blood libel case. \n\nThere were 150 Jewish families living in Nachod in 1852. Shortly thereafter, however, the population began to decline as Jews were, for the first time, able to live in larger towns and cities where they had more economic and educational opportunities. By 1893 approximately 630 Jews lived in Nachod; the 1921 census indicated that the Jewish population had dropped by then to 463, and by 1930 there were 293 Jews living in Nachod (2.1% of the total population). \n\nIn 1902 there were 100 Jews living in 22 villages and small towns that were affiliated with Nachod's Jewish community. Among them were formerly prominent communities such as Hronov, Cerveny Kostelec (German: Rothkosteletz), and Police nad Metuji. \n\nDuring the interwar period the newly-formed Republic of Czechoslovakia recognized the Jews as a national minority with concurrent rights. This prompted a strong interest in Zionism. In 1934 the Moller brothers transferred their textile factory to Palestine and founded the Ata Company in Kiryat Ata. \n\nAmong the rabbis of Nachod were Heinrich (Chaim) Brody, who served from 1898 to 1905, and Gustav Sicher. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nBohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany in March, 1939, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the area's Jews. In June 1939 Nachod's synagogue was desecrated; that July the Gestapo raided Jewish homes. The cemetery was also mostly destroyed. Beginning in 1941 Czech Jews were sent to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were deported to concentration and death camps, where most were killed. Before the community's deportation, its ritual objects were sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nAfter the war a small congregation was established; this congregation was affiliated with the Jewish community of Liberec, and was founded mostly by veteran soldiers from Subcarpatian Ruthenia. Nachod also became an important transit station for the Berichah movement, which organized groups of Holocaust survivors to illegally emigrate to Mandate Palestine. \n\nIn 1958 a monument was erected in memory of the victims of the Holocaust. The remaining tombstones in the cemetery that had not been destroyed during the war were destroyed during the 1950s. The synagogue building was demolished during the 1960s. \n", "He": "\u05e0\u05d0\u05db\u05d5\u05d3 NACHOD\r\n\r\n\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d1\u05e6\u05e4\u05d5\u05df-\u05de\u05d6\u05e8\u05d7

Republic \n\nThe synagogue and cemetery are the only remaining parts of the Jewish Quarter. The synagogue is used as a church. The cemetery has over 1,000 tombstones, most dating to the 17th and 18th centuries with the oldest tombstone dating to 1577. The cemetery, along with the smaller new cemetery (which was consecrated at the end of the 19th century), is owned by the Jewish community of Prague. \n\nHISTORY \n\nJews are first mentioned in town records dating from 1514. The community purchased land for a cemetery in 1520 and a synagogue is first mentioned in 1559 (it would later be renovated in 1660 and 1838). In 1570, ten Jewish families were recorded as living in the town. Between 1656 and 1670 most of Novy Bydzov's Jews worked as salt merchants. The community was temporary expelled after an outbreak of plague; some of its members founded communities in the surrounding villages. \n\nThere were 90 Jewish families living in Novy Bydzov in 1724. Three years later they were segregated in a special Jewish Quarter (the Jewish Quarter would eventually be destroyed in a fire at the turn of the 20th century). In 1744 the community grew after absorbing Jews who were expelled from Prague; by 1786 the Jewish community owned 37 houses in the town.  \n\nA new cemetery was consecrated in 1885. By 1893 there were 838 members of the Jewish community, some of whom lived in the 35 surrounding villages. \n\nIn 1930 the Jewish community of Novy Bydzov numbered 148 (2.1% of the town's total population). \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nBeginning in 1942 the 98 Jews who remained in the town were deported to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto; when the community was deported, the synagogue equipment and documents were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. From Terezin they were sent to concentration and death camps. One person survived. \n", "He": "\u05e0\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9 \u05d1\u05d9\u05d3\u05d6'\u05d5\u05d1 NOVY BYDZOV\r\n\r\n(\u05d1\u05d2\u05e8\u05de\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea: NEU BIDSCHOW)\r\n\r\n\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8

Carpathian Mountains. Until 1918 it was part of the Austrian Empire. During the interwar period, and between the end of World War II until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Between 1938 and 1945 it was one of the municipalities of the Sudeten Region.  \n\nThe Jewish cemetery contains memorials to Holocaust victims, in addition to a pre-burial house. It is owned by the Jewish community of Ostrava and can be accessed freely. \n\nHISTORY\n\nJews are recorded in Novy Jicin during the middle of the 14th century as homeowners and cloth merchants. The Jewish Street (Judengasse), which included 46 houses in 1581, was located next to the castle; Jews were, however, permitted to live on other streets as well. When the community was expelled in 1562 its leaders sold the synagogue to the mayor and handed the cemetery over to the city, with the request that it not be damaged. They then left to settle in the surrounding villages. \n\nJews returned to the vicinity of Novy Jicin in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and by 1828 a few privileged families were permitted to live in the town itself. It was only after the 1848 emancipation of Jews throughout the Austrian Empire, and the subsequent removal of economic and residence restrictions, that Jews were allowed to return to live in Novy Jicin (the townspeople violently objected to their new Jewish neighbors, and in 1850 local authorities were called to suppress attempts to organize anti-Jewish riots). The community was granted the status of a kultusverein (an independent political entity) in 1868, and in 1892 the community was officially recognized. \n\nA cemetery was consecrated in 1875, and a synagogue was established in 1908. Most of the town's Jews worked as traders or in the local textile industry. In 1921 the first hakhsharah farm in Moravia, which trained young Jews for eventual emigration to Mandate Palestine, was established in Novy Jicin. Jews owned a large sawmill and developed a local hatmaking industry.   \n\nIn 1847 the Jewish community numbered 14 people. By 1868 that number had jumped to 155 and in 1880 there were 275 Jews living in Novy Jicin. At the turn of the 20th century the Jewish community numbered 253, and in 1930 the community numbered 206 (1.4% of the total population).\n\nAfter the Sudeten Crisis of 1938, which resulted in the dissolution of the Republic of Czechoslovakia and the annexation of the Sudeten Region, including Novy Jicin, to Nazi Germany, the Jews of Novy Jicin fled and the community was dissolved.

Republic\n\nOlomouc is located on the Morava River. It is an administrative center of the Olomouc Region, and the sixth-largest city in the Czech Republic. Until 1918 Olomouc was part of the Austrian Empire. During the interwar period, and between the end of World War II and 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. \n\nThe Jewish community of Olomouc is an active congregation that offers a number of religious, cultural, and historic activities for locals and visitors alike. It is also responsible for the care of religious and cultural activities and monuments in the communities of Bruntal, Jesenik, Prerov, and Sumperk. \n\nThe Jewish community of Olomouc holds regular Shabbat services, holiday celebrations, and festive meals. Services are conducted either by the cantor, the community chairman, or the visiting rabbi. The community builds a sukkah for the holiday of Sukkot, and has a kosher kitchen that is used to prepare communal meals. Funerals take place in Neredin, a village within Olomouc. \n\nA monthly periodical \"Chajejn\" (\"Our Life\"), informs community members about past community events, communal history, as well as current and upcoming communal events. The newspaper also tracks the lives of local Holocaust survivors. \n\nCommunal institutions include a Ladies' Club and a Gentlemen's Club. Social services support the city's poor and elderly Jews, and are financed by the Claims Conference and the Foundation for the Victims of the Holocaust. Community members benefit from community-organized trips, lectures, and cultural events. The community also offers kosher catering and apartment accommodations for visitors. \n\nOlomouc's surviving Jewish cemetery is part of a larger municipal cemetery. Though it is smaller than when it was established in 1900, it still contains a funeral hall and approximately 1,000 graves. The cemetery also contains a memorial to the Jewish victims of World War I, as well as a Holocaust memorial, which was unveiled on May 5, 2005. The funeral hall and the Holocaust memorial are designated as protected monuments. \n\nOlomouc is also home to the Stolpersteine. Developed by the German artist Gunter Demnig, the Stolpersteine are 10 x 10 x 10cm concrete cubes inscribed with the name, date of birth, and date and place of death of an individual who was killed in the Holocaust. These stones are placed in front of the house where the individual lived before their deportation and murder. The Stolpersteine commemorating the Jewish victims of the Holocaust in Olomouc began to be placed throughout the city in 2011. \n\nAs of 2012 the Jewish community of Olomouc had 154 members.  \n\nHISTORY\n\nJews are first mentioned in 906 CE, in an agreement regulating the taxes paid by Jews. At that time Jews lived among the area's Christians (and not segregated in a Jewish ghetto). A prayer house was located at the foot of Mount Julius. In 1060, however, the Jews were segregated in one part of the town. They were forced to pay special taxes, as well as to wear a yellow patch that would identify them as Jewish. The Crusades, which swept through the town periodically from the end of the 11th century through the 12th and 13th centuries, rendered life dangerous for the city's Jews. Most of the Jews living in Olomouc during this period worked as traders and artisans.  \n\nThe Jews' quality of life improved in 1254 under King Ottokar II, who renewed the privileges granted to the Jews by his father, Wenzel I. King Wenzel II and King Karl IV also honored the Jewish charter. The relationships between Olomouc's Jews and their leaders were good; in 1311, when King Johann visited Olomouc, he was received by a procession of Jews carrying Torah scrolls and singing.\n\nThese warm relationships would not last, however. In 1454 King Ladislaus the Posthumus expelled the Jews from Olomouc, an expulsion that would later be confirmed in 1745 by Queen Maria Theresa. Nonetheless, a small number of Jews under the protection of the authorities were allowed to stay in the town from Monday through Friday. \n\nJews were allowed to resettle the town only after the emancipation of Jews throughout the Austrian Empire in 1848 and the subsequent removal of residence restrictions. Even then, however, the local Jewish population grew slowly because of local opposition to Jewish settlement. Leopold Hamburger of Prossnitz, who leased a brewery and had come to live in Olomouc, was expelled, even though he was legally allowed to settle there. Another Jew was driven away by locals throwing stones. \n\nNonetheless, a Jewish community began to grow. A prayer house was dedicated in 1863. A Jewish Cultural Union was founded in 1865. The Jewish cemetery was consecrated in 1867. The government recognized the Jewish community as an independent religious and cultural community in 1892, a time when Olomouc's community began to flourish. A magnificent synagogue was inaugurated in 1897, and a new cemetery was consecrated in 1903. Dr. Berthold Oppenheimer was elected as the community's first rabbi, and Edward Hamburger became the leader of the community; he would be succeeded by Jakob Even, who led the community until 1913. \n\nCommunal institutions included a chevra kaddisha, a women's society, a Free Table Organization, which supported Jewish students, a literary society, a branch of Bnei Brith, and a mutual aid society named after Adolf Kraus. \n\nIn 1903 there were 2,198 Jews living in Olomouc (3.4% of the total population). The community grew even larger after World War I, when it absorbed refugees who had fled from Poland. The Jewish community of Olomouc eventually became the third-largest Jewish community in Moravia.  \n\nMost of the community's members were industrialists. Factories and manufacturing plants owned by local Jews included a malt factory, an acetone-producing plant (owned by the Briess family, which used a patent that belonged to Israel's first president Chaim Weizmann), and the Heilkur vegetable oil production plant. Sigmund Zweig, the community's vice president, was also the vice president of the tradesmen and artisans union. Some members of the community were also engaged in academic or professional work.\n\nBy 1897 Zionism had become a major influence in the city. The Austrian Zionist Congress took place in Olomouc; that same year a branch of the Zion movement was opened in the city, led by Wilhelm Spitzer. Jewish students affiliated with the Zionist student movement Geulah worked to promote the Zionist cause during their vacations. A branch of Blau Weiss was opened in 19193, followed by the youth movement Maccabi.  The sports club, which had been active since 1901, became the Maccabi Club in 1927. Additionally, the Zionist sports organization HaKoach opened a chapter in Olomouc in 1913 and organized a professional soccer team in the city. \n\nThe Republic of Czechoslovakia, which was established after World War I in the wake of the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, granted the Jews cultural and national autonomy. Jews throughout the country became more politically active, and Zionist activity increased. In 1919, two representatives from the Jewish National Party were elected to the local council of Olomouc. Dr. Ludwig Meissner, who hailed from Olomouc, was elected to the Central Committee of Zionist Organizations. For some time Olomouc acted as the regional center of Zionist activities. The sixth regional Zionist conference took place in Olomouc in 1924, and the city's Jews purchased membership and voting rights before the elections to the 15th Zionist Congress; 191 Jews from Olomouc would later participate in elections to the 20th Zionist Congress in 1937. The socialist Zionist party Poalei Zion was reestablished in the Republic of Czechoslovakia in 1928, initiated by  several Jews from Olomouc led by Oskar Huber. Dr. Oskar Zweigental was elected to the central committee of the Jewish Partyafter its establishment in 1931. \n\nIn 1930 there were 2,198 Jews living in Olomouc.\n\nAmong the notable figures from Olomouc were the composer Leo Fall and the music conductor Fritz Zweig. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nA number of Jews from the Sudeten Region settled in Olomouc after the annexation of Sudetenland to Nazi Germany in 1938. On March 15, 1939, Bohemia and Moravia were occupied by Nazi troops, and Germany declared the region to be a protectorate of the Third Reich. This ushered in a period of discrimination and violence against the region's Jews. Shortly thereafter, when the city was occupied, three S.A men accompanied by local Germans went to every Jewish home in the city early in the morning and arrested all of the Jewish men. These men were imprisoned for several days before being taken to the concentration camp Dachau in Germany. On the night between March 15 and 16, 1939, the synagogue was set on fire. Local firemen were ordered to prevent the fire from spreading to the adjacent buildings but not to prevent the synagogue from burning down. Jewish students were subsequently expelled from school; their parents responded by setting up classes in their homes. \n\nAt the beginning of October 1941 there were 4,015 Jews living in Olomouc.\n\nDuring the second week of May 1942, the city's Jews were ordered to register for transfer. On June 26, 1942, approximately 900 Jews were sent from Olomouc to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. Further transports took place on June 30, July 7, and July 8, 1942. The last Jews remaining in the city (those who were classified as \"essential,\" as well as those who were married to Christians) were sent to Terezin on March 7, 1945. From there they were deported to concentration and death camps, where most perished. In total, 3,494 Jews were deported from Olomouc and the surrounding areas. \n\nBefore the deportation from Olomouc 1,913 documents, 343 books, and 140 ceremonial objects from the community were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague.\n\nPOSTWAR\n\nApproximately 280 members of the Jewish community of Olomouc and the surrounding areas survived, 200 of whom returned to the city after the war. A prayer house was established, as well as a chevra kaddisha and a mutual aid society. The community celebrated holidays, and organized concerts featuring Jewish music. Rabbi Dr. Richard Feder, who lived in Brno, provided the communities in the district, including Olomouc, with rabbinic services. \n\nIn 1948 there were 354 Jews living in Olomouc, 246 of whom registered as part of the Jewish community. \n\nIn 1949 a Holocaust memorial was unveiled in the Jewish section of the general cemetery. There were also memorial plaques affixed to the cemetery's ceremonial hall. \n\nA small synagogue was consecrated in Olomouc in 1955.\n\nThe community had 450 members in 1959, including Jews from the towns of Sumperk, Usov, Kojetin, Prerov, Lipnik, Hranice, Jevicko and Prostejov. After emigration depleted the community's population, these towns joined the Jewish community of Moravska-Ostrava, with the exception of Prostejov which joined the Jewish community of Brno. \n\nThe location where the synagogue once stood was turned into a small park; during the postwar communist area the park held statues of Lenin and Stalin. The site was subsequently turned into a parking lot. On March 7, 1990, a memorial plaque was affixed to Palach Square, to mark the site where the synagogue once stood. The plaque's inscription reads: \"On this site stood the synagogue which was burned to the ground by local Nazis on the first day of the occupation, March 15, 1939. Of this religious community, 2,292 members fell victim to Nazi genocide. \n\nIn 1991 the Jewish community of Olomouc was led by Emy Donatova and had 55 members, including six children and four teenagers. A similar number of Jews who did not wish to officially identify themselves as Jewish also lived in Olomouc. The Jewish community employed a cantor, celebrated Jewish holidays together, organized lectures, and was active in the Czechoslovak-Israel Friendship League.", "He":

These houses would eventually make up the Jewish Street, which was surrounded by a fence. Carts were not allowed to enter the Jewish Street on Sabbaths and festivals.  \n\nThe community expanded at the beginning of the 19th century and in 1817 a prayer house and cemetery were consecrated. \n\nThe oldest family in the community was the Stadler family. Their descendents included an international merchant, and the founders of a leather and suede factory at Visokany.\n\nIn 1870, after the emancipation of Jews throughout the Austrian Empire in 1848 and the subsequent removal of residence restrictions, Jews were permitted to settle in the subdistrict town of Rokicany. Most of the Jews from Osek chose to move to Rokicany and were among the founders of its community. They still maintained Osek's cemetery of Osek and some were buried there when they died. Otherwise, however, the Jewish community of Osek ceased to exist.

During the interwar period, and from the end of World War II until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia.  \n\nOne of the Torah scrolls sent from Ostrava to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague during World War II is currently located in the Kingston Synagogue in the United Kingdom. \n\nHISTORY\n\nA few protected Jews (those who were shielded by the local nobles in exchange for taxes and other services) were living in Ostrava by 1508, but the general Jewish population was not permitted to settle in the city until after the emancipation of Jews throughout the Austrian Empire in 1848, and the subsequent removal of residence restrictions.  Until then there were a small number of Jews living in the town, both legally and illegally. In 1792, after Emperor Joseph II issued the Tolerance Edict in 1782, a Jewish man named Mordehai Schoenhoff settled in the town and rented a wine store. Later a few Jews arrived from Hotzenplotz, Leipnik, and Ungarisch-Brod. During the first half of the 19th century Jews from Silesia, Moravia, Slovakia, and Galicia began to settle in Ostrava. Those who came to Ostrava from the east tended to be more religious, and the community that they established was more traditional; it was these Galician arrivals who established a mikvah (ritual bath) and an Orthodox synagogue. \n\nOnce Jews were allowed to freely settle in the city, communal life began to flourish. A synagogue was built in the Polish part of the town in 1857. A Tarbut society was established in 1860 and led by Shimeon Fraenkel. That year also saw an influx of Jews after Ostrava was ordered by the emperor to remove any remaining residence and economic restrictions on the Jews. A Jewish cemetery was consecrated in 1872, following a cholera epidemic. From 1860 until 1875 the Jewish community was made up of Jews from Moravska Ostrava and the neighboring Polska Ostrava (German: Plnisch-Ostrau). Beginning in 1875, however, the Jewish community of Moravska Ostrava became independent. A community committee was subsequently established, led by Berthold Schwartz, and replaced Tarbut. Marcus Strassman was appointed as the community's leader, with Dr. Joseph Wachsberg acting as his deputy. A new synagogue was consecrated in September 1879, with thousands of people in attendance. \n\nIn 1881 the community numbered 700 members. During this period at the end of the 19th century, Ostrava became known as the \"Moravian Manchester,\" due to its increasing importance as an industrial center. The Rothschild and Gutmann families, in particular, owned important coal mines and ironworks in the area. This brought Jews to the city from all over Moravia and Galicia; by 1890 the Jewish population had reached 1,356 and in 1900 the Jewish population was 3,272. \n\nA number of synagogues were built in Ostrava's suburbs in order to accommodate the influx of Jews; an Orthodox synagogue would later be added to the rest in 1926 and the city would ultimately be home to six synagogues. Rabbi Dr. Bernhard Zimmels, the community's first rabbi, was appointed in 1890. Rabbi Zimmels passed away in 1893 and was succeeded by Dr. Yaakov Schapira in 1903. Marcus Strassman, the first leader of the community, was succeeded by Dr. Alois Hilf after his death. \n\nCommunal institutions included an old age home, a Bikkur Holim, a women's society, a home for children, and a Bnei Brith lodge. A Hebrew school was established in 1863; it was officially recognized by the authorities as an elementary school in 1884, the same year that the language of instruction was changed to German (the school's language of instruction would eventually be changed to Czech, after the establishment of the Republic of Czechoslovakia); Hebrew was taught for 2 hours each day. By the end of the 19th century the school enrolled 303 students, and had 7 classes. There was also a vocational boarding school affiliated with the metal industries of the Austrian branch of the Rothschild family, which attracted students from all over the Republic of Czechoslovakia. A summer camp for Jewish children was established in 1912. \n\nIn 1918 Dr. Reuben Faerber established a publication and sales company; most of the published books dealt with Jewish and Zionist subjects. During the interwar period Julius Kittels Nachfolger published a German translation of the Talmud. \n\nThe Republic of Czechoslovakia recognized the Jews as a national minority with concurrent rights, prompting Jews throughout the country to become active Zionists, as well as to take an active role in local politics. The Jews of Ostrava obtained 60 seats in the town council in 1921, including representatives from the Jewish Democrats, the Zionist Party, Jewish Laborers, and Jewish Czechs. In 1931 the first Jewish Party conference was held in Ostrava, and in 1935 Ernst Fisher was elected as the party's representative in the Senate. Dr. Alois Hilf was the president of the Federation of the Jewish Communities of Moravia in the National Jewish Council. Dr. Zigmund Witt was a member of the Senate while Dr. Victor Haas was a member of the Parliament. \n\nMany members of the community were active Zionists; in fact, beginning in 1921 the executive committee of the Zionist organizations of Silesia and Moravia was located in Ostrava. Many Jews in the city contributed generously to Keren HaYessod. Jewish students worked to spread Zionist ideology, particularly among the youth. Zionist organizations held their conventions in the city and a branch of the Palestine Office was opened. Zionist groups that were active included Poalei Zion, Achdut HaAvodah, Mizrachi, Revisionist Zionists, HeHalutz, HaShomer HaTzair, HeHalutz HaKlal Zioni, Blau Weiss, Maccabi, as well as a number of others. Kedmah, a group to prepare young Jews to emigrate to Mandate Palestine, was established in 1924. Community members bought membership and voting rights before the 15th Zionist Congress, as well as in subsequent years; 518 Jews from Ostrava participated in the elections to the 20th Zionist Congress. \n\nIn 1931 there were 6,865 Jews (5.4% of the total population) living in Ostrava.\n\nAmong the notable figures from Ostrava were the playwright and poet Marcel Meir Faerber, who later became a journalist and wrote for the Tribuna in Bratislava and Yediot Khadashot in Israel. Joseph Wechsberg, a writer and literary critic, as well as the editor of the Jewish weekly Selbswehr (published in Prague), was born in Ostrava in 1907.\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement of September, 1938, which dissolved the Republic of Czechoslovakia and annexed the Sudeten Region to Nazi Germany, Ostrava absorbed waves of Jews fleeing from the region. In March, 1939 however, the region of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the area's Jews. Ostrava was the first city to be occupied by the Nazis, who burned the city's six synagogues. The city's Jews began to be deported soon after; the first transports took Ostrava's Jews to Poland, while later transports sent them to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From these locations they were sent to concentration and death camps, where most perished. \n\nBefore the deportations began, 348 ritual objects, 680 books, and 246 documents from Ostrava's Jewish community were sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nApproximately 250 survivors returned to Ostrava after the war and reestablished a Jewish community. Eventually the communities of Bohumin, Karvina, Krnov, Opava, Prlava, and Olomouc became affiliated with Ostrava's Jewish communit; the entire community consisted of 500 Jews. Ostrava had a cantor, while the regional rabbi, Rabbi Dr. Richard Feder, lived in Brno. 649 Jews lived in Ostrava, 548 of whom were officially registered in the community. \n\nA new cemetery was established in 1965. The old Jewish cemetery was destroyed during the 1980s and the remaining tombstones were transferred to the cemetery in Silesian Ostrava.  \n\nIn 1997 the Jewish community of Ostrava had 80 members. \n\n", "He": ""}, "UnitText2": {"En": null, "He": null}, "UnitPlaces": [], "main_image_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/bhs-flat-pics/12C29C4E-37C2-4B90-81D9-B523BB0E6726.jpg", "DisplayStatusDesc": "Museum only", "UnitHeaderDMSoundex": {"En": "ZZ E043970 ZZ E697450 ZZ ", "He": "ZZ H043970 ZZ H679745 H697450 ZZ "}, "UnitDisplayStatus": 2, "RightsCode": 1, "UnitId": 71982, "IsValueUnit": true, "StatusDesc": "Completed", "PlaceParentTypeCodeDesc": {"En": "Region"}, "PlaceParentId": 113067, "UserLexicon": "56210|56370|56663|56838|57174|57213|57313|57348|133989|133992|", "Attachments": [], "geometry": null, "Slug": {"En": "place_ostrava-moravska", "He": "\u05de\u05e7\u05d5\u05dd_\u05d0\u05d5\u05e1\u05d8\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05d5\u05d4-\u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05d1\u05e1\u05e7\u05d4"}, "Header": {"En": "Ostrava Moravska", "He": "\u05d0\u05d5\u05e1\u05d8\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05d5\u05d4 \u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05d1\u05e1\u05e7\u05d4"}, "thumbnail_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/bhs-thumbnails/12C29C4E-37C2-4B90-81D9-B523BB0E6726.jpg", "ForPreview": false, "_id": "71982"}, {"LocationInMuseum": null, "Pictures": [{"PictureUrl": "https://storage.googleapis.com/bhs-flat-pics/677D657F-3E6B-47ED-B880-0B9D0FDCDDA6.jpg", "PictureId": "677D657F-3E6B-47ED-B880-0B9D0FDCDDA6", "IsPreview": "0"}, {"PictureUrl": "https://storage.googleapis.com/bhs-flat-pics/0E89DA02-BFD1-478B-BD00-25E3B265BCCD.jpg", "PictureId": "0E89DA02-BFD1-478B-BD00-25E3B265BCCD", "IsPreview": "0"}, {"PictureUrl": "https://storage.googleapis.com/bhs-flat-pics/51F1D64E-EA44-4111-9266-62CD7A1781DD.jpg", "PictureId": "51F1D64E-EA44-4111-9266-62CD7A1781DD", "IsPreview": "0"}, {"PictureUrl": "https://storage.googleapis.com/bhs-flat-pics/F1195D99-1B96-4421-B539-CA96C91CA3EF.jpg", "PictureId": "F1195D99-1B96-4421-B539-CA96C91CA3EF", "IsPreview": "0"}, {"PictureUrl": "https://storage.googleapis.com/bhs-flat-pics/B38D22C1-C0E5-4CA8-A231-DC3543BDB8DB.jpg", "PictureId": "B38D22C1-C0E5-4CA8-A231-DC3543BDB8DB", "IsPreview": "1"}], "PictureUnitsIds": "130662|34873|16946|46324|34529|", "related": ["image_the-synagogue-in-pardubice-czechoslovakia-c1930", "image_chamber-ensemble-of-jewish-musicians-pardubice-czechoslovakia-1900", "image_rosh-hashana-greeting-card-pardubice-bohemia-1900-1930", "image_the-young-girl-mitzi-tayn-from-pardubice-bohemia-1912"], "UpdateDate": "2016-05-22 09:34:00", "OldUnitId": "HB068383.HTM-EB068423.HTM", "id": 192199, "UpdateUser": "administrator", "PrevPictureFileNames": "313.I.64.12.jpg|20807000.JPG|01651100.JPG|03438900.JPG|20734030.jpg|", "PrevPicturePaths": "Photos\\677d657f-3e6b-47ed-b880-0b9d0fdcdda6.jpg|Photos\\00001004.scn\\20807000.JPG|Photos\\00001004.scn\\01651100.JPG|Photos\\00001237.scn\\03438900.JPG|Photos\\00001025.scn\\20734030.jpg|", "PlaceTypeCode": 2, "TS": "00000000005b9afd", "PlaceTypeDesc": {"En": "Town", "He": "\u05e2\u05d9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4"}, "UnitType": 5, "UnitTypeDesc": "Place", "EditorRemarks": "hasavot from Places ", "UnitStatus": 3, "RightsDesc": "Full", "Bibiliography": {"En": "List, Miriam Hajnal\n\nhttp://www.iajgsjewishcemeteryproject.org/czech-republic/pardubice.html\n\nhttp://www.east-bohemia.info/pardubice/13_4840_pardubice-jewish-cemetery/\n\nhttp://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/rescued-torah-creates-bond-across-time-and-place/", "He": "\u05de\u05e7\u05d5\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea, \u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05d9\u05d9\u05e0\u05dc"}, "UnitText1": {"En": "Pardubice\n\nGerman: Pardubitz\n\nA city in the Czech Republic\n\nPardubice is the capital of the Pardubice Region. It is located on the Elbe River, 59 miles (95km) east of Prague. Until 1918 Pardubice was part of the Austrian Empire. During the interwar period, and after World War II until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. \n\nThe Jewish cemetery contains tombstones dating from the 17th century through the 20th century. The cemetery also includes a Holocaust memorial, marked mass graves, and a memorial for the bones that were transferred from the old cemetery in 1883. The Jewish community of Prague owns the cemetery, and funds its continual care. The cemetery can be visited with permission. \n\nOne of the Torah scrolls sent from Pardubice to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague during World War II is on permanent loan to Congregation Beth Shalom in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey. \n\nHISTORY\n\nA document dating from 1492 mentions a Jew from Pardubice. However, until the end of the 16th century only a small number of Jewish families were allowed to live in Pardubice, under the protection of the noble house of Pernstein. After the Catholic Church expelled the Hussites from the town, the Jews were able to purchase the houses of the expelled Hussites. \n\nA Jewish community was founded at Pardubice during the 17th century. The first Jews who settled in Pardubice were merchants with trade connections in Germany, Holland, and Poland. In 1617, under pressure by the Christian merchants, special taxes were levied on them, which would last until 1645 when the rights of Jewish merchants were expanded and their tax burden was eased. Daniel Moises of Friedland leased the collection of royal customs in the town and also dominated the trade in grain, salt, and other foods. After the expulsion of the Jews, in spite of the objection of local traders, he was allowed to remain living n Pardubice.  \n\nAt the end of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) a number of Jews began arriving in Pardubice, expanding the community but also leading to tension with the local Christian residents. Ultimately, in 1662 the Jews who had arrived after 1618 were expelled. These expelled families settled in the surrounding area and established a number of smaller communities; by the end of the 17th century, until 1724, these expelled Jews living in the area were forbidden from burying their dead in the Jewish cemetery at Pardubice. \n\nIn 1745 the entire Jewish community of Pardubice was expelled. Two years later only one Jew, Daniel Veselsky, was permitted to settle in the town and to work as a distiller. \n\nIn 1801 there were 56 Jewish families belonged to the community of Pardubice, two of whom lived in the city itself while the rest lived in 38 villages in the area. In 1848, however, Jews throughout the Austrian Empire were emancipated, and residence restrictions were subsequently repealed. Jews began moving to Pardubice itself shortly thereafter; in 1851 five Jewish families lived in Pardubice and by 1880 the city's Jewish population was 378. A synagogue was built that year and expanded in 1904. The old Jewish cemetery, which was originally dedicated in 1624, underwent a number of expansions before being closed down in 1882; its tombstones were moved to the new cemetery, which was dedicated in 1883. Victor Vohryzek, one of the founders of the Czech-Jewish movement, is buried among those buried in the new cemetery.\n\nJewish children attended a private school in which the language of instruction was German. A Jewish women's society was also active. The community's president during the 1830s was Moses Kraus; he was succeeded in 1855 by Marcus Oesterreicher. When Oesterreicher died in 1897 Dr. J. Berthold became the community's president; he was succeeded in 1929 by Karl Winternitz. During the 1920s Rabbi Adolf Nahnadel served the community. \n\nAfter World War I, with the establishment of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, the Jews were recognized as a national minority with concurrent rights. This prompted many to become active in the Zionist movement, and for some time Pardubice became a regional center for Zionist activity.  In 1926, before the elections to the 15th Zionist Congress, the Jews of Pardubice purchased membership and voting rights. During the 1937 elections to the 20th Zionist Congress, 24 Jews from Pardubice participated. \n\nIn 1921 554 Jews were living in Pardubice. In 1930 518 Jews were living in Pardubice.\n\nAmong the notable figures from Pardubice were the painter, actor, and playwright Emil Arthur Pittermann-Longen, as well as the singer and national theater producer Hanus Thein (1904- 1974).\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nIn March, 1939 the region of Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the region's Jews. \n\nIn the beginning of October 1941 records show that there were 1,554 Jews in the Jewish community of Pardubice. Between May 18 and 24, 1942, the Jews of Pardubice were ordered to register with the authorities in preparation for their deportation. In December of that year, the Jews of Pardubice were deported on two separate transports to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps, where most perished.  Before their deportation to Terezin, 30 documents, 11 books and 215 ritual objects belonging to the community were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague.\n\nOn December 31,1944, there were 194 Jews left in Pardubice, most of whom were married to non-Jews. A few months later, on April 30, 1945, when the fighting in the region ceased, there were 178 Jews in Pardubice, 28 of whom were concentration camp survivors. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nIn 1945 the synagogue was converted into a cultural center; it would eventually be demolished in 1958. In 1946 the board of the Jewish Communities of Bohemia established a home in Pardubice for 65 elderly Jews. In 1948 the community erected a statue in the Jewish cemetery which listed the names of all of the Jews from Pardubice and the surrounding area who were killed in the Holocaust. The community house, which included a prayer hall that was originally founded in 1867, was destroyed in 1958, along with the city's synagogue. \n\n", "He":

"UnitText1": {"En": "Podebrady\n\nGerman: Podiebrad\n\nA spa town, Central Bohemian Region, Czech Republic. \n\nPodebrady is located on the Labe River, 31 miles (50km) east of Prague. Until 1918 Podebrady was part of the Austrian Empire. During the interwar period, and between the end of World War II and 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. \n\nJews are first mentioned in Podebrady during the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). In 1677 a local nobleman, Hansdorf Humberk, granted the Jews two houses on the outskirts of Podebrady, along with a guarantee of his protection. In 1743, however, Queen Maria Theresa ordered the expulsion of the Jews form Podebrady and other towns in the area on the charge of collaboration with the Prussians; the Jews appealed to the court and were then allowed to stay. With the edict of tolerance issued by Emperor Joseph II in 1782, the Jews of the area were subject to fewer residence restrictions and persecutions. In 1826 there were 8 Jewish families (36 people) living in the town. Public prayers were held in one of the houses on the estate, which was managed by Jews until the middle of the 19th century.\n\nThe first Jewish settlers in Podebrady worked as traders, peddlers, and distillers; by 1638 Jews also worked as toll collectors, owned a distillery, and traded hides and other products. Though the municipality was against the settlement of Jews in the town, the nobles granted them protection in exchange for the special taxes they paid, as well as the economic benefits that they derived from the Jewish presence in the town. Jews who did not live in the town but wished to trade in it needed the consent of Joseph Borias, the representative of the local protected Jews.\n\nThe Jewish community was officially organized during the 19th century, at which time a prayer house was established. The building housing the prayer house was destroyed by fire in 1843; it was subsequently rebuilt and served as a prayer house until 1892. A Jewish cemetery was consecrated near the general cemetery in 1898; until then, the Jews used the Jewish cemetery of Kovanice.\n\nA number of small Jewish communities in the area were affiliated with Podebrady. These included Bosin, which had a prayer house during the 19th century, Rodzalovice, which had its own synagogue, Sadka, which had a prayer house during the 18th and 19th centuries, and Cineves, which built its own synagogue in 1857.  \n\nA regional synagogue was established at Nymburk for the towns of Podebrady, Nymburk and Mestec Kralove, all of which were owned by the same noble family. The synagogue was built using funds donated by the three communities. An elementary school, whose language of instruction was German, was built on a site near the prayer house in Podebrady. Though the school was Jewish, it was also attended by a number of Catholic children. The community also built a home for the rabbi. After the emancipation of Jews throughout the Austrian Empire in 1848, and the subsequent removal of economic and residence restrictions, Jews began to play a larger role in the development of trade and industry in Podebrady. Members of the community founded the Slivovitz distillery, a factory for extracting vegetable oils, a beer brewery, and a large wheat-marketing company. One Jewish man owned a large agricultural farm. There were also Jews of the liberal professions in Podebrady, including physicians, lawyers, and teachers.\n\nAfter the emancipation, Jews also became active in local politics, a trend that accelerated after World War I when the Republic of Czechoslovakia recognized the Jews as a national minority with concurrent rights. After the war, one Jewish man was elected to the town's council. \n\nIn 1921 there were 120 Jews in the community. Abraham Ruzicka was the community's leader, and J. Weil was the rabbi. Most of the community's Jews spoke Czech.   \n\nAmong the well-known figures from Podebrady were the writers and German poets Rudolph Fuchs (1890-1942) and Franz Janowitz (1892-1917). Franz Kafka\u2019s mother was born in Podebrady.\n\nIn 1930 there were 269 Jews were living in Podebrady and the surrounding area. Of these, 111 lived in the town itself.\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nOn March 15, 1939, Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the area's Jews. Beginning in 1942, the Jews of  Podebrady were deported to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were sent to concentration and death camps, where most perished. Before being sent to Terezin, 45 ritual objects from the community were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nAfter the war, survivors from the community returned and reestablished a Jewish community; in 1946 there were 171 Jews living in Podebrady. That year, a home for the elderly was opened and housed 65 elderly Jews. \n\nIn 1948 there were 115 Jews living n Podebrady, 92 of whom were registered in the community. The synagogue building was taken from the community that year to serve as a museum store; it would be demolished in 1958. In its place, the community dedicated a prayer room in the old age home, which was used until 1965.  \n\n", "He": "\u05e4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05d9\u05d1\u05e8\u05d0\u05d3\u05d9

"UnitText1": {"En": "Podivin\n\nGerman: Kostel\n\nA town in the Czech Republic\n\nPodivin is located 27 miles (approximately 43km) southeast of Brno. Until 1918 it was part of the Austrian Empire. During the interwar period, and between the end of World War II and 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia.\n\nOne of the Torah scrolls sent from Podivin to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague during World War II has been on permanent loan to Makom Shalom, in Chicago, Illinois, since 1996. \n\nThe Jewish cemetery contains hundreds of gravestones, the oldest of which dates to 1694. There is also a ceremonial hall with a small exhibition. The cemetery is owned by the Jewish community of Brno, and can be freely accessed. \n\nHISTORY \n\nIt is thought that a Jewish community existed at Podivin during the 17th century and, like many other communities in Moravia, was dispersed during the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). After the war Jews returned to Podivin; in 1673 there were 18 houses that were owned by Jews. At the end of the 17th century additional Jews arrived from Poland, seeking refuge in Podivin after the Khmelnytsky massacres. \n\nThere were two Jewish Quarters in Podivin. One, which was located southwest of the town square, contained 20 Jewish houses. The other, located north of the town square, held 40 houses. The Jewish Quarters were administered as an independent municipal entity and had their own Jewish mayor. \n\nThe synagogue was built in the southern Quarter sometime during the 17th century, and was renovated in 1820. A cemetery, which replaced an older cemetery that had fallen into disuse, was dedicated during the second half of the 17th century; it would be expanded in 1872. During the 17th and 18th century most of the Jews worked as traders in salt, tobacco, wine, wool, goose liver, and fat. \n\nThe rabbis that served the community during the 17th century included Rabbi Monish b. Isaiah Teomim (d. 1684), who was also the head of the local yeshiva, and Rabbi Benjamin Wolff. Rabbi Eliezer Trillinger was the community\u2019s rabbi at the beginning of the 18th century. Rabbi Mordecai, Rabbi Abraham Baack, and Rabbi Moses Blatt served the community during the 19th century; Rabbi Shimshon Abraham Kulke was the rabbi between 1838 and 1894 and was succeeded by Rabbi Dr. Shimon Mandl, the author of theological and philosophical works who served from 1894 until1899. Rabbi Dr. Mandl was succeeded by Rabbi Abraham Weiss, who served between 1899 and 1903. The scientist and publisher Rabbi Duschinsky served between 1904 and 1907 (among his works, he recorded the history of the rabbis of the Great Synagogue of London between the years 1756 and 1842) and was succeeded by Rabbi Dr. Jacob Hoffmann, who served between1908 and 1912; Rabbi Dr. Hoffman, in turn, was succeeded by Rabbi Dr. Adolf Deutsch, who led the community between 1914 and 1920. Rabbi Judah Neumann was the community's rabbi beginning in 1921. After 1929 the community did not have its own rabbi and instead was served by the rabbi of Breclav, located 5 miles (8km) from Podivin.  Community leaders included B. Straussler, Isidor Rosenzweig, and Arthur Neumann are known as the head of the community. \n\nDuring the 1860s the community opened a Jewish elementary school, which contained three classes. 130 students were enrolled in the school in 1890, but the school eventually closed due to lack of enrollment. Other communal institutions included a chevra kaddisha (founded around 1870), a women\u2019s society and a Talmud Torah society. \n\nA number of local Jews enlisted in the Austro-Hungarian army during World War I (1914-1918); 14 fell in battle. Their names were inscribed on a memorial tablet in the synagogue.\n\nThe Republic of Czechoslovakia, which was established in the wake of World War I, recognized the Jews as a national minority with concurrent rights. This prompted a surge in Zionist activity in Podivin and throughout the region. An Eretz Yisrael organization was formed, along with the sports organization Maccabi and the youth movement Maccabi HaTzair. In 1926, prior to the elections to the 15th Zionist Congress, community members purchased membership and voting rights; before the elections to the 20th Zionist Congress in 1927, far fewer community members purchased membership and voting rights. \n\nThe Jewish community, which numbered 42 families in 1768 and 81 families (407 people) in 1787, reached its peak size in 1857, when the Jewish population was 684. Later, the population gradually began to decline. In 1900 there were 435 Jews living in Podivin. In 1921 about 300 Jews were living in the town, most of whom spoke Czech. In 1930 there were 196 Jews living in Podivin.\n\nAn interesting, and unique, fact about the community is that it included 14 families with the last name of Spitz. Apparently they had all originally arrived in Podivin from a small town of the same name on the Danube River.\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nIn March, 1939, Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the region's Jews. The Jews of Podivin were sent to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto beginning in late 1941 through 1942. From there they were deported to concentration and death camps, where most perished. Before the community was sent to Terezin, 150 documents, 4 books, and 150 ritual objects from the community were sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague.  \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nSix Jews from the original community returned to Podivin after the war. Jewish life in the town was not revived.", "He": "\u05e4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05d1\u05d9\u05df Podivin\r\n\r\n\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d1\u05de\u05d7\u05d5\u05d6 \u05d1\u05d6'\u05e6\u05dc\u05d0\u05d1

Until 1918 it was part of the Austrian Empire. During the interwar period, and between the end of World War II until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. Between 1938 and 1945 Pohrlitz was one of the municipalities in the Sudeten Region. \n\nThe Jewish cemetery contains tombstones dating from the second half of the 17th century. The area behind the church is known as the Zidy quarter (Jewish quarter), after the Jewish Quarter that once existed there. \n\nHISTORY\n\nA legend maintains that a Jewish community existed at Pohorelice by the beginning of the 10th century, which would make it the first Jewish community in Moravia. However, the earliest written document of a Jewish community dates to the year 1490.\n\nDuring the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), the Jews of Pohorelice experienced a great deal of upheaval, and many were injured. By the end of the war, 20 of the 43 Jewish homes were not inhabited. In 1657 additional Jews came to live in the town, including Rabbi Loew, who served as the community\u2019s rabbi.\n\nThe Jews of Pohorelice worked mostly as traders (particularly horse traders), moneylenders, craftsmen, and leased inns. Some worked as itinerant peddlers who roamed the country and returned to their homes for holidays and festivals. The Jewish community lived in crowded quarters and the taxes they paid were ten times higher than the taxes paid by Christian residents. \n\nIn 1788 about 100 Jewish families were living in 37 houses in Pohorelice. Two years later, in 1790, the number of Jews living in Pohorelice was 453 (34% of the total inhabitants); the population reached its peak in 1857, after the emancipation of Jews throughout the Austrian Empire and the repeal of residence restrictions, when 769 Jews were living in the town. Shortly thereafter, however, Jews began moving to larger towns and cities, seeking greater economic and educational opportunities and resulting in a decline in the local Jewish population; in 1900 there were 498 Jews living in Pohorelice.\n\nThe town's Jewish Quarter was administered as an autonomous entity, with a Jewish mayor, usually the community's leader, who was referred to as the \"judge of the Jews.\" Additionally, the community employed a rabbi, a cantor, a beadle (shammash), and two night guards to watch over the Jewish Quarter. After the emancipation, however, the administration of the religious community was separated from the civil administration. In 1919, following the establishment of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, the Jewish Quarter was incorporated into the Christian part of the town, at which point the Jewish community functioned only as a religious entity, and not a political one. The last Jewish mayor was Heinrich Ellinger.\n\nThere was an old Jewish cemetery in Pohorelice but it has not been found; a second Jewish cemetery was consecrated before 1676. The old synagogue, which had quite possibly been the oldest in Moravia, was destroyed in 1853; a new synagogue was consecrated in 1855. The community also had a prayer house that was used during the winter, a community center, and a library. Communal institutions included a Talmud Torah school, a Talmud study group, a chevra kaddisha (burial society); a women's society became active starting at the end of the 19th century. In 1835 a new mikveh (ritual bath) was built.The community\u2019s register was started in 1790. \n\nIn the beginning, Jewish children attended general schools and studied religious subjects separately. In 1847 the community opened an elementary school, whose language of instruction was German. This school was closed down with the establishment of the Republic of Czechoslovakia and was replaced by a Czech school.\n\nAmong the Rabbis of Pohorelice were Rabbi Avigdor Paltiel, a descendant of kabbalah scholars from Raschpitz, who died in 1749; Rabbi Lev; Rabbi Yehuda Lev Freund (called \"Berlin,\" d. 1855) who served for more than 30 years and was also the head of the yeshiva; Rabbi Joshua Weiss, who served for 49 years beginning in 1862; Rabbi Moshe Freidiger, who served between 1912 and 1913 and later became the chief rabbi of Copenhagen; Rabbi Rudolph Ferda, who served until 1921 when he was succeeded by Rabbi Dr. Heinrich Gescheit. \n\nAfter the emancipation, Jews began to take an active role in local politics. Hermann Schnabel, the head of the community, was elected to the town council in 1905. The involvement of the Jews in public life intensified following the establishment of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, which recognized Jews as a national minority with concurrent rights. Jews throughout the country, including those from Pohorelice, began identifying themselves as Jewish nationals, leading to a major rise in Zionist activity. In 1926, prior to the 15th Zionist Congress, the Jews of Pohorelice acquired membership and voting rights; in 1937, in spite of the population decline that had taken place within the Jewish community of Pohorelice, a number of community members participated in elections to the 20th Zionist Congress. A branch of the Zionist youth movement Maccabi was also active in Pohorelice.\n\nIn 1921 there were 360 Jews in the community, whose president was Hermann Schnabel. In 1930 277 Jews were living in Pohorelice (about 5% of the total population).\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nThe Munich Agreement of September 1938 resulted in the dissolution of the Republic of Czechosolvakia and the annexation of the Sudeten Region to Nazi Germany. The vast majority of the Jews living in the Sudeten Region fled, many for areas in Bohemia and Moravia. In March, 1939, however, this region became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews living there. Beginning at the end of 1941 the Jews of the protectorate were sent to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were deported to concentration and death camps, where most were killed. \n\nBefore the community's deportation, 148 documents and 66 ritual objects from Pohorelice were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. The Germans destroyed Pohorelice's synagogue and Jewish cemetery. Between 1944 and 1945 a transit camp operated at Pohorelice, where Jewish prisoners from Hungary were kept en route to Terezin, and ultimately concentration and death camps.  \n\nPOSTWAR\n\nAfter the war the Jewish cemetery was repaired, but Jews no longer lived in the town.", "He": "\u05e4\u05d5\u05d4\u05d5\u05d6'\u05dc\u05d9\u05e6\u05d4 Pohorelice\n\n(\u05d1\u05d2\u05e8\u05de\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea:

between 2011 and 2014, as was the rabbi's house, which is located next door to the synagogue. The rabbi's house includes a winter prayer room, as well as a mikveh (ritual bath). The synagogue contains an exhibit on the history of Polna's Jewish community. There is also an exhibit about the Hilsner blood libel; the murder prompting the blood libel took place near Polna, and the Jewish man who was falsely accused was from Polna.  \n\nThe cemetery can be accessed with permission.\n\nOne of the Torah scrolls that was sent from Polna to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague during World War II has been on permanent loan to Congregation Beth Shalom in Kona, Hawaii, since 1985.  \n\nHISTORY\n\nJews are mentioned as living in the area in sources dating to 1415; two Jewish families are listed as living in Polna itself in 1570. A law manual for the town from 1582 also contains an option for oaths that Jews could take when they appeared in court.\n\nA Jewish cemetery was established in 1619. In 1681 Jewish and town representatives signed an agreement to build a Jewish Quarter of 16 houses (one of its gates was still standing as of 1970). The synagogue was built in 1684 and renovated during the 18th century. The synagogue, along with 32 homes, was destroyed in a fire that broke out in 1863; it was subsequently rebuilt. \n\nThere were 27 Jewish families living in Polna in 1724, and 541 Jews lived in the town in 1847. In 1869 there were 430 Jews in Polna, and 238 in 1890. In 1930 the community numbered 51 (1.2% of the total population).  \n\nThe Hilsner blood libel trial of 1899 was a major incident in Polna; Leopold Hilsner, who was accused of murdering a Christian woman in a forest near Polna, was from the town. \n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nIn 1942 the Jews who remained in Polna were deported to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto; from there they were sent to concentration and death camps. Before the deportation to Terezin, the synagogue equipment was sent to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague. The synagogue was used to store confiscated Jewish property. \n\n", "He": "\u05e4\u05d5\u05dc\u05e0\u05d4 POLNA\r\n\r\n\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d1\u05de\u05d6\u05e8\u05d7

Until 1918 it was part of the Austrian Empire. During the interwar period, and between the end of World War II until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. \n\nThe synagogue building has been used as an Orthodox church since 1951; at the beginning of the 21st century the church was repaired and two memorial tablets were placed in the church, commemorating the Jewish and Orthodox victims of World War II. \n\nThe new Jewish cemetery, which was consecrated at the end of the 19th century, can be accessed freely. Its size was reduced after World War II in order to develop the surrounding area, but a few hundred tombstones (including some that were transferred from the destroyed old cemetery) have remained standing. The cemetery includes a special section for refugees. \n\nHISTORY\n\nJews are on record as living in Prerov before the 14th century; by 1447 there is mention of a Jewish street in the suburb of Sirsava. Prerov's Jewish community grew when the Jews of Olomouc were expelled in 1454 and some came to settle in Prerov. The Jews lived in Prerov under the protection of the local nobility, who granted them a number of rights.\n\nIn 1564 eight Jewish families lived in the town with permission; other Jews lived in the town illegally, though the exact number of illegal Jewish residents is unknown.  By 1614 the number of Jewish families living in Prerov had grown to 16. In 1638 they were permitted to consecrate a cemetery, to set up prayer houses, to build a hospital, and to install a water system for a mikveh (ritual bath). Jews were also granted permission to purchase homes.\n\nThe first Jews who settled at Prerov were mostly traders. In 1355 they were permitted to trade in the town\u2019s markets on Tuesdays and Friday, once every two weeks. Other Jews worked as craftsmen and farmers. The protection charges that the Jews had to pay were high, and they also paid considerable taxes for trading rights, as well as for every new Jewish settler in the town. In the year 1600 the right of Jews to own inns was temporarily repealed, and was renewed in the middle of the century. \n\nAn earthquake in 1590, a storm in 1591, and a flood in 1593 resulted in heavy damages in the town and the Jewish Quarter. Later, in 1664 the town suffered heavy damages after a fire. In 1717, after a plague epidemic, only 82 people remained in Prerov. Seven more fires broke out between 1762 and 1828, each of which wreaked havoc and destruction in the town. Sixty-four houses on the Jewish Street burned down in 1831. In addition to the considerable property damage, the Jews had to contend with the fact that each time that the town's ownership changed hands, they needed to fight for their rights to be renewed. \n\nThe Jewish community began to flourish only after 1848, when Jews throughout the Austrian Empire were emancipated, and economic and residence restrictions were subsequently removed. A synagogue was built in 1860 at the western end of the Jewish street, on the same site where an older synagogue, which was already in use by the 17th century, had been destroyed by fire in 1832. The old cemetery was consecrated in 1515 and closed down around 1888. A new cemetery was established in its place in 1882. Other communal institutions included a community house and a library. \n\nIn 1724 Jews owned 14 houses in Prerov; by 1830 that number had risen to 21 houses. In 1829 there were 44 Jewish families (286 people) living n Prerov. By 1834 that number had increased to 341, out of a total population of 4,583. In 1901 the Jewish population reached 717, out of a total population of approximately 17,000. In 1921, when the community was led by Heinrich Tauber, the Jewish community numbered 336 people, out of a total population of 49,569.\n\nThe community of Prerov was officially recognized in 1877; at that time the head of the community was Sigmund Hahndl. Hahndl was the first of 15 more community leaders, the last of whom was Dr. Wilhelm Roubicek, who was appointed in 1926. Among the rabbis who served the community were Rabbi Abraham, most probably the first Rabbi of the community, who served during the 16th century, Rabbi Isak Homburg, who served at the end of the 17th century, Rabbi Samuel Schick, a frequent correspondent of Rabbi Moses Sofer (the Hatam Sofer), who served towards the end of the 18th century ; Rabbi Solomon Fried, who was appointed in 1793, Dr. Jacob Tauber, who was appointed in 1886, Dr. Oskar Karpeles, who served as a rabbi in the army during World War I, and Dr. Leopold Goldschmied, who served during the 1930s. \n\nAfter the emancipation of 1848, Jews were no longer subject to economic restrictions and could choose to work in a number of professions. In addition to shopkeeping, Jews worked as physicians, lawyers, and teachers. When Prerov became connected to the country\u2019s railway network, Jews were employed both as workmen and as railway company officials.\n\nThe Republic of Czechoslovakia, which was established in the wake of World War I, the Jews were recognized as a national minority with concurrent rights, prompting many Jews to participate in political life, as well as to begin identifying themselves as Jewish nationals. In 1919 a delegate from the Jewish National Party was elected to the town\u2019s council. Students from the Masada society worked to spread Zionism during their university vacations, and the youth movements Maccabi and Blau Weiss were also active. In 1926, in anticipation of elections to the 15th Zionist Congress, community members from Prerov purchased 119 shekels (membership in the zionist organization and a voting right); in 1937, during the elections to the 20th Zionist Congress, 15 members of the community participated. \n\nIn 1930 there were 267 Jews living in Prerov.\n\nAmong the notable figures from Prerov was the composer and pianist Gideon Klein, who was born in Prerov in 1919 and was killed in 1945 at the Fuerstengrube concentration camp.\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nIn March, 1939 Bohemia and Moravia became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the Jews living there. Beginning at the end of 1941 Jews throughout the region, including Prerov, were sent to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were deported to concentration and death camps, where most perished. Before the community was expelled to Terezin, 338 documents, 20 books, and 82 ritual objects from Prerov were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague.\n\nPOSTWAR\n\nFour survivors returned to Prerov after the war, but Jewish life was not renewed. Beginning in 1950 the synagogue building was used by the Orthodox Church. Local authorities demolished the ancient cemetery in 1956, and some of the tombstones were transferred to the new cemetery. In 1980, however, the area encompassing the new cemetery was reduced, and the Zidduk Hadin pavilion was destroyed.

Republic\n\nPrestice is located on the Uhlava River, 12 miles (20km) from Pilsen. Until 1918 it was part of the Austrian Empire. During the interwar period, and between the end of World War II until 1993, it was part of the Republic of Czechoslovakia.\n\nFourteen Torah scrolls were sent from Prestice and the surrounding villages to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague during World War II. Each of these scrolls found a new home after the war, and can be found in the following communities: Westminster Synagogue of London, Congregation Beth Or of Maple Glen, Pennsylvania, Shalom Day School of Sacramento, California, Temple Sinai of Sharon and Temple Israel, both in Sharon, Massachusetts, Wilshire Boulevard Temple of Los Angeles, California, Temple Beth El Co-op City in the Bronx, New York, North Country Reform Temple of Glen Cove, New York, Temple Beit Hayam in Stuart, Florida, the Jewish Reconstructionist Congregation in Evanston, Illinois, the Jewish Federation of Hawaii in Honolulu, Hawaii, and Congregation Beth El of Yardley, Pennsylvania. Two Torahs from the community of Prestice are also on permanent loan to the Ministry of Religious Affairs in Jerusalem. \n\nThe Jewish cemetery contains a number of tombstones dating from the 20th century. There is a Holocaust memorial, along with a surviving pre-burial house. The Jewish community of Plzen owns the cemetery and finances its maintenance. The cemetery can be accessed with permission. \n\nHISTORY\n\nJews were living n Prestice since the 15th century, but an official Jewish community did not exist until after the emancipation of Austrian Jews in 1848, after which residence and economic restrictions were removed. According to the census of 1862, there were 715 Jews living in the entire sub-district of Prestice; by 1890 the Jewish community of Prestice was officially recognized by the authorities. Shortly thereafter, however, the population began to decline as Jews began moving to larger towns and cities in search of greater economic and educational opportunities. In 1900 there were a total of 431 Jews in Prestice and the surrounding areas. \n\nIn spite of the population decline, the community of Prestice began to stabilize at the beginning of the 20th century, when other Jews from the area moved to live in the town. A cemetery was consecrated, and a synagogue was built in 1910. At that point, the community became the center of a community that included seven smaller Jewish settlements in the area. Prestice also became the headquarters of the regional rabbinate. \n\nA Jewish school was opened in Prestice, which served the wider Jewish community. The language of instruction was German, and it was successful enough that a number of Christian children enrolled along with their Jewish neighbors. In 1894 the religious school was disbanded; religious lessons were run under state supervision in the public school. \n\nMost of the Jews living in Prestice were economically stable. Many of those living in the town itself traded in textiles while in the surrounding villages Jews worked as farmers and cattle traders. Others worked as distillers and produced soda water and liqueurs.  \n\nIn 1921 the greater community numbered 185 Jews. Joseph Hartman was the head of the community. Rabbi Leopold Singer served as the community\u2019s rabbi for 41 years, until his death in 1934s.\n\nAmong the notable figures from Prestice was the writer and collector Georg Leopold Weisel (1804-1873), who also published Jewish folktales.\n\nIn 1930 there were 126 Jews were living in the wider Prestice community, 99 of whom lived in the town itself.\n\nTHE HOLOCAUST\n\nIn March, 1939 the region of Bohemia and Moravia, which included Prestice, became a protectorate of Nazi Germany, ushering in a period of discrimination and violence against the area's Jews. On November 26, 1942, forty-one Jews from Prestice were sent to the Terezin (Theresienstadt) Ghetto. From there they were deported to concentration and death camps, where only three survived. Before their expulsion to Terezin, 152 documents and 212 ritual objects from the community were transferred to the Central Jewish Museum in Prague.\n\nPOSTWAR\n\nJewish life was not revived in the area of Prestice after the war. The Jewish community of Plzen sold the synagogue building to the Czech Brethren in 1948, for use as a church. The building was demolished by the Czech authorities in 1974.", "He": "\u05e4\u05d6'\u05e9\u05d8\u05d9\u05e6\u05d4 PRESTICE\r\n\r\n\u05d1\u05d2\u05e8\u05de\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea:
